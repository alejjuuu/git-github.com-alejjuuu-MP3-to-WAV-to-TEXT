Code is to convert mp3 to wav then wav to text to finally process the data (books and summarize the content)
Work is currently at the stage of translating all wav to files by parsing each wav file into multiple chunks to easily process each part evently without losing data.
The tranlationg from wav to text is acurrate; however, the summarizing does not work as of now since the output is not coherent.

Currently developing a solution with NTLK models.
