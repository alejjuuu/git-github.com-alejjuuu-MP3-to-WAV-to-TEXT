Step 1: Install Required Libraries
   
pip install spacy nltk transformers sumy

spaCy and NLTK are useful for NLP tasks like tokenization and sentence parsing.

Sumy will be used for basic text summarization.
Transformers will be used to leverage models like BART for advanced summarization.


Step 2: Pre-Processing the Book Text

First, load and pre-process the book text (assuming it's stored in a text file). We will break the text into manageable chunks and create a clean dataset for summarization.


import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

# Download necessary NLTK data (if you haven't already)
nltk.download('punkt')

# Read the book content from a file
with open('book.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    book_text = file.read()

# Tokenize the book into sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(book_text)

# Display the first 5 sentences
print(sentences[:5])




Step 3: Summarizing the Text Using Basic Summarization (Sumy)

For initial summarization, we'll use the Sumy library to generate a concise version of the book, summarizing sections into key points.


from sumy.parsers.plaintext import PlaintextParser
from sumy.summarizers.lsa import LsaSummarizer

# Create a parser for the text
parser = PlaintextParser.from_string(book_text, PlaintextParser.from_string(book_text, 'utf-8'))

# Use LSA summarizer to generate a summary (e.g., summarize into 5 sentences)
summarizer = LsaSummarizer()

# Generate a summary
summary = summarizer(parser.document, 5)  # Adjust number of sentences

# Display the summary
for sentence in summary:
    print(sentence)



Step 4: Advanced Summarization Using BART

For more advanced summarization, use the BART model from the transformers library. BART is capable of producing more coherent and contextually relevant summaries.




from transformers import pipeline

# Load the pre-trained BART model for summarization
summarizer_advanced = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Summarize the first 1024 characters of the book text (adjust based on text length)
summary_bart = summarizer_advanced(book_text[:1024], max_length=150, min_length=50, do_sample=False)

# Print the BART-generated summary
print(summary_bart[0]['summary_text'])





Step 5: Chunking and Organizing Information (Active Note-Taking)


def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=1024):
    """Chunks the text into smaller sections"""
    return [text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]

# Chunk the book text
chunks = chunk_text(book_text)

# Now summarize each chunk
chunk_summaries = [summarizer_advanced(chunk, max_length=150, min_length=50, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text'] for chunk in chunks]

# Display summaries of the first few chunks
for i, summary in enumerate(chunk_summaries[:5]):
    print(f"Summary of chunk {i+1}:", summary)



Step 6: Teach What You’ve Learned (The Feynman Technique)

The idea here is to test your knowledge by summarizing or explaining the content. You could create a function to ask yourself questions about the content, then answer them.

Here’s an example that generates questions based on chapter headings and checks your recall:

import random

# Sample list of questions for recall testing
questions = [
    "What is the main concept in Chapter 1?",
    "How does the author explain the importance of small habits?",
    "What is the 2nd Law of Behavior Change?",
    "What are the practical strategies provided in Chapter 3?"
]

def test_recall(questions):
    """Simulates active recall by asking questions and checking answers"""
    random.shuffle(questions)
    for question in questions:
        print(f"Question: {question}")
        # Here you'd answer the question from memory (manually in this case)
        input("Your answer (press Enter when done): ")
        print("Check if your answer is correct based on your notes or summary.\n")

# Call the recall testing function
test_recall(questions)


Step 7: Spaced Repetition for Long-Term Retention

You can create a spaced repetition system to remind yourself to review key concepts at increasing intervals. Here's how you could implement a basic version:


import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a simple spaced repetition schedule
def spaced_repetition(review_date):
    """Simulates a spaced repetition system by setting review dates"""
    next_review = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=review_date)
    print(f"Next review date: {next_review.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
    return next_review

# Example: Review in 1 day, then 3 days, 7 days, etc.
review_intervals = [1, 3, 7, 14]

for interval in review_intervals:
    spaced_repetition(interval)



Step 8: Apply the Knowledge (Practical Use)


To apply the knowledge, you could implement the main concepts from the book into code or tasks. For example, if the book is about habit formation, you could create a habit-tracking app or a simple program to track progress. Here’s a basic habit tracker example:



Step 9: Final Integration Summary

Once you've worked through all chunks, you can combine all summaries into a final overview:


# Combine all chunk summaries into one final summary
final_summary = "\n".join(chunk_summaries)

# Display the final summary
print("Final Book Summary:\n")
print(final_summary)
