Artificial intelligence can be hard to define because it can be subjective. Ai can be either a human or a machine, but it can also be a combination of the two. Machine learning can be applied to a wide range of industries. It can be used to improve the quality of the content we see.

The data warehouse sits between the video wait and the deed analyst at proxy almost like a cash layer between the data source an analyst in the same way that if you've ever worked with web development is a thing called men cash deed the few stand up in front of your my seat pulsar work and have a proxy requests. The first step down the pike for state analytics is to do a deal warehouse deal warehouse.

's for business intelligence these are two very similar rules very related rolls there is a new wants difference in these roles are more likely to be differentiated from each other
a larger companies were we have lots of rolston filled as opposed to smaller companies were one person wears many hats so both of these roles deal in analytics deal in skirts in graphs we take our gate at the data warehouse in we won't hear around in our hands we look at top we look at the bottom in order to make fuel minute decisions that's what makes these roles different than machine learning machine learning makes automated decisions in our state ale
lakes or business intelligence is for humans and machine learning it is for robots will get to that and at the data analyst is more of a technical rolled data analyst is actually will likely to be involved in the entire dia science pipe line up until this point everything we've already discussed such as injection into a deal wait feature engineering and working with the data warehouse is likely to also be tasks
formed by david analyst in addition to the actual analytics task of shorting n. grafting looking at the day that in order come up with human decisions where as a business intelligence person the b. b. i've professional is typically a less technical role there are less likely be involved in the entire data science pipeline up until this point and instead it is likely to be working with the data from the day warehouse
the consumer as a user and a giveaway difference between these two roles is the troll in the eye people will be using b. i. specific schools things like tout low ti eap ltd you and power b. i. by microsoft and quick site on amazon aided us whereas the day that analysts is probably get actually be doing their analytics themselves with cold by way of python in jupiter no books
with map lot lid and seaborne talk about those things in a future episode or during the deed engineering phase of the pipeline by way of things like amazon dino wrangler work amazon glue date abreu so analyst says more of a tactical rolled and baby i've personal less technical rule that state analytics david driven decision-making for schumann's so de analyst may take the tweaks out of our
data warehouse and then charting graf something's look at the optimal time to talk weeks during the day and what day of the week based on the engagement of those streets number retreats a number for plies an go running the bosses say boss boss we should between at noon on tuesday based on my research of the data that today analyst machine learning now we go down the right side of the fork in the road in the branch of our pipes machine learning is automated production
it's it's productions and decisions made by robots our essay robots of course i'm being clock will by machine learning models so rather than shorting and grafting degas as an analyst would do a machine learning engineer will design a model using sheen learning tooling things like cancer flow care ross hi torch psychic learned x g boost maybe all hosted in the clouds using sage maker says it will learn the patterns of the tweaks so that
can a cotton make projections or maybe even take actions sir rather than coming up with a conclusion then is optimal two sentries at noon on tuesday the machine learning engineer might build a model that literally sense streets at noon on tuesday they take this step further and maybe they might write in and l. p. model whereby the marketing team can feed it something they wanna say the machine learning model will construct the optimal way to save
that's using an elk he put that into which we send out at noon on tuesday so that's the day the science pipeline is the flow from left to right of the dead at injection put that into a lake apply some stuff upon our weight whether it's permission in war unified steam up pull out a lake in future engineer it clean up the day yes stored in the future store of your left towards the panelists first we hit the day
the warehouse which does some further transformation of our day is so they can be a real time proxy today analysts for fast clearing the panelists have more of a technical role in doing analytics charring in grafting on dinner for human decisions and the b. i. people have all less technical role for the same viewer writes to the machine learning engineers to build on the maid of the predictive models nobody's indeed as scientists to ban well that's all
that nebulous and the reason is the reason is it depends on the size of the company you work for if you work for mom and pop shop and you were there all media person that has indeed a scientist your role is everything everything that is listed you been handled each phase in the day the pipeline but if you apply to a larger organization like frank corporation facebook amazon apple mac flicks google then is likely the case that you will be applying
as a role for any one phase all this pipeline so for example goebel might have an entire day this science team and that team is broken down into the day engineering team the analytics team in the machine winning team and then you might apply to the machine learning to him or the feature engineering team in other words depending on the size of the company anyone phase in the hierarchical breakdown of the day the science that is it
candidate for role as it is scientists and so were you might find is that people may market themselves by either as specific roles which date analysts business intelligence machine learning engineering or deed engineering or they may market themselves as india scientists quote unquote either implying that they can handle everything in the sack or that they're looking to be more generally up little maybe they're targeting smaller companies morning where multiple hats and in a company might be look
and for the team of scientists typically meaning they want somebody who can handle any and all of the moving parts in the data science pipeline or they may specify which specific role it was the machine mining engineer or the data analyst were featured engineer and that's why can be confusing sometimes the difference between machine learning and davis science mouth which of these role should the u. s. abiding engineer in the space targets machine learning date analytics did it
engineering or the whole data science back well technology from web development there's fraud and server database and down lots as an example and some are you tackles the entire staff calls themselves awful stack engineer you can either specialize in fraud and and it really good at it there's a lot to know about just for an end for example similarly machine learning is enough to tackle all on its own keep you busy for a lifetime
there's an owl lobster machinery operations deploying your machine running models to the clark developing in training your models on various tool kit slight pipe scorch and to answer flow deploying optimize saying in monitoring your models all these things could keep you busy for a lifetime and you could take eager salt exclusively the machine learning don't be a coven of summary dedicating themselves exclusively to from an engineering where other roles in the day the science that are analogous to other roles know whether velma stack
so it depends on if you wanna tackle the entire stack at large or if anyone portion of this fact sounds more appealing than another one about machine learning versus ai now i did mention the machine learning is assuming the various some domains all day i've but that's not necessarily or completely the case at least not yet and so machine is more of an industry practice a professional feel that if you want independence tree i would choose machine learning
over artificial intelligence you might get a master's machine learning our data science where is targeting artificial intelligence is kind of that to be scientific chasing the rain both the pot of gold of the future that's more of an academic and ever so if you wanna stay in academia and push the scientific frontier then targeting ai conceptually would be immoral wind been targeting machine learning so that's davis science artificial intelligence and machine
learning now i'm going to take the history of ai that i had regionally recorded in twenty seven teens episode to an end just to make inserted here scott or re record that stuff to fury listen episode two you can stop listening now if this is your first listen through keep on listening okay so we've covered the definition of our consultants the definition of machine learning and now finally let's go into that
history of artificial intelligence and recommend you some really good resources that i've picked up a minute from around the web some common recommendations but people who are looking for good history information on our official tells it's so are the sorts of this goes way way back away back further than you imagine starting with greek mythology and then you're coming on jewish with all due of columns and this is actually very interesting point to me that's artificial intelligence has sort of been conceived of in the dawn of you
yeah maybe it's almost like it's part of it was kind of our our quest read it back to that actually in the next episode which is artificial intelligence inspiration will try to inspire you around our chortled of michigan for netscape than mind that we we didn't think about arthur shortage of sense at least greek mythology the first attempt at actually implementing cannot thomas han think this guy's name is raymond wall and thirteenth century leonardo da vinci was working on board made some walking animals saitama time to dig ha
and whiteness know they have a lot of her for philosophical musings and one consciousness and whiteness are co created calculus stuff that was used in the development of ai a algorithms mathematics and baltimore think about ai so this infuriate out ai has been around for very long time the real degree stuff 'cause are happening around seventeen hundreds in the eighteen hundred's the curious olive servant statistics and mathematical decision-making were first most important figures is thomas b.
he's worked on reasoning about the probability of events so thomas days reasoning about the probability of events remember the name he's become up again multiple times in the future the c. n. inference is very important phenomenal component of machine so he is a very big figure george poole who was involved in logical reasoning in by ariel throats got lot friday with proposition all logic so these were components in the development of computers in general but also in the velma machine running
charles babbage an idea byron slash love lovelace in eighteen thirty two design the analytical engine to the program bowl calculating machines and then he was in nineteen thirty six that we got the universal turing machine and if they don't want people consider that have kept up with computers now entering design that can stick concept of a programmable computer with his universal turn she is also just about as alan trying was very interested in ai he talked about but yeah as an art
caller computing machinery and intelligence or he was thinking about ai pre early on as well ninety four eight six john vaughan knowing and uses at countering to your full time machine the annulment of his universal computing machine if i'm not mistaken and we've universal turing machine was the theoretical and universal confusion estimated computer i think jamal none maybe architecture firm for scum of universally can programmable computer and allison research against the actual machine on except during an artificial intelligence in ninety four three warren look
like an walter pits the kind of built the computer or representation of the new on that later fine by frank rosenblatt to create the perception on an award percent on come up come up later this the first artificial new round of course it's that those an artificial neuron by way of called a motel where perception zyuganov showed no my work and that is the plumbing that's fun stuff so you call it and that's an rosenblatt three v.
important figures was until nineteen fifty six that the word artificial intelligence was coined by a john mccarthy that the darkness workshop so dark john mccarthy marvin minsky arthur samuel all over south ridgeway solomon off our nolte and herbert simon all came together at dartmouth into that at this workshop in nineteen thirty six and their goal was to simulate all aspects of intelligence and quotes him as the definition of artificial
thousands of beginning with our guest says guys to find ai they created a field of it and then they set off work and so at the workshop it was kind of what hath ahmed them open to act on the dis crack that mule inside increase your sticks to branch purist extends human incurred this thing called general problem solver did you receive the creation of computer vision natural language crossing shaky the robot says between the nineteen fifties and nineteen seventies so there were few of them on this at the actual dartmouth workshop
the mail truck to the projects home to their own universities they continue crack at these things we call the sort of the golden era of artificial intelligence is when was that an explosion of interest and in research and joy and light in the field fight fight embalmed creeps experts systems this is also sort of the creation above what we call good old-fashioned ai because later you'll see we can switch gears 'em away we do ai in today's generation good old-fashioned ai or go far
a g. o. p. f. b. i. uses an approach called symbolism these are logic based approach is knowledge based experts systems basically where the knowledge to end the logic is kind heart coded into the system and full well that it's little bit like that once and twice for moving now joe use back and play checkers little bit less magical maybe then the connection is an approach of nomo works by at some of the experts including marvin minsky during this time for the side of go five symbolism and they said
dead the connection is an approach a partial neural networks one hold that has some problems so this was the golden arrow to the fifties and set the fifties to the seventies a golden era of explosion research and ideas and discoveries and developments by some of the most important hundred influential mains in the history of artificial intelligence or you'll read any book on the doors also little bit of adversity between some of the players and like i said so so connection is um began to be
criticize due to something blows cold comet comets coral explosion basically y'all networks work too hard copy to show it to heart on the computer to be effective at generalizing solutions going forward on the heel that's in the nineties seventies came up this report by james white help call bill like phil report and listed that's damage to the field aboard the schwan totems so let us set this is between the fifties and seventies on this
golden era wasn't suing the artificial intelligence when the world was just vibrate and excited about ai and in that excitement darpa yom the military defense and lots of companies invested into these guys these major players and create companies around these technologies there's a lot of hype a lot of excitement and binder delivery he was almost like a silicon valley's bubble blast it was almost like they said we can do anything in the whole universe because for some u. n.
intelligence anything you could imagine no actually we can simulate that but in fact of course it's little bit more difficult than that we're getting closer every day by day under delivered in too long over time and so people started cutting fines and spreading grandstand having contracts with contractors and bowater that was due to this like hell report which was basically report on all these come up negative aspects saying yes indeed these guys are by not one issue and the
the whimpering so that create what we call the ai winter ai went underground and very few people were funny anymore the ai winter lasted for about the seventies until the nineties is starting to make a comeback in the reasoning come back why is that the ice friendly sword have some practical applications in terms of these diehards that we're heading in the cave they knew that you would that have real application industry is this violence and making to practical use of ai without some lofty promises
so for example advertising and recommended engines which are two of the most commonly used applications of our official tokens in modern era the other thing is that the computers got better so remember that one of the reasons for the ai winter honored to liberate was due to this common toward oaks lotion that these generalization generalizing algorithms could not perform on the computers of that modern time but they could perform on computers twenty years later thirty year
later the nineties into thousands that they are really certain pick up steam again and finally the last piece the puzzle was the one thing that you're gonna find the money to teach you in later episodes is that the accuracy of your machine learning algorithms improve the more to you have hands with the internet becoming so popular and to becoming so prevalent all over unit which scrape web pages and there's accel spreadsheets and databases ever aware of this and that's business you're in our rooms have basically
it's a goldmine of misha work with the smooth arrow was called the degas now you can work with all the data that you fingertips you can imagine big data it's okay i finally made a comeback if i may have had this day i spring after that ai winter another reason i think that hey i'm a combat which i know here are tara what was actually optimization study our rhythms though they say that our computers are really fast so the cop competition we've got more fish episode is that the algorithm so for example in two thousand six jeffrey henson
optimize the back propagation our rhythm which made it our official neural networks substantially more tractebel and put connection isn't back on the map in fact i believe it was that the sort of solidify connection as um as a really powerful commonly used technique going for an egg go find symbolism certain to go out of vogue finally we have the modern era two thousand two thousand seventeen currently bloomberg says that two thousand fifteen was for water for the ai industry and i don't really
no why i think maybe what happened is just it just that this graph this cause to be on the rise sense the nineties is finally hit keep that it's become really popular in the modern are now almost any technology companies adopting machine learning an artificial thompson's the hiring machine mining engineers new data scientists like never before so we're if spool ocean of ai factors little bit of concern this could become another balboa smothered at which are the law that people who say that that probably will happen that we're actually really do
while the our rooms in the data that algorithms a very precise to the amount of data we have the computing machines we can scale these algorithms horizontally across in aid of us closer all the sins sort of very very good time for machine one very interesting and good time to be alive see what's happening now is one company that will draw attention to an this'll be my final point on history of our official told shuns the company's name is he might indeed mine was acquired by tula boys and twin fourteen do you mind that first was kind of just
playing games to use artificial intelligence system using deep learning approaches like the cue networks in order to play an old classic inside pond in benchley old console games and more recently modern consul gains weight from playstation such but doable saw potential in the types of things that they were doing with deep learning in out reinforce atlantic specifically an acquired them and keep my husband putting out why they have just then demolishing the field of machine learning in artificial intelligence there
probably the most present figure in the news of our official told us today they put out papers all the time making big splashes in research and development something i mentioned previously color differential computer which brought the sub field of knowledge representation and reasoning into the domain of machine running for example deep mine is something to keep very close eye on they're doing some really interesting work these days okay so that's a history of artificial and
knowledge and so we covered what is a guy the definition was machine morning compared ai was mission learning compare today's science compared to statistics why is an owl the sort of essential some field of ai what is the history of ai can brief if you're interested in the history of ai and the definition of ai i'm going to provide some resources this one book it's commonly recommended an all points out i'm the show not so good to show notes o. c. d. e. feed the bell
oh see the bell dot com and this'll be episode two negatively suffrage than history of machinery so in the next episode on going to try to help and spire edu to be interested the field of chaotic and specifically in mushy learning think that this episode was probably rather boring the next episode of all that says i have plans so far the next episode i think will be the most fond episode it's been a deep inspiration around field of ai worth talk about the senior wearied huh
i just missed automate automation above the entire industry some really philosophical and crazy stuff so i'll see you then


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash famine belt he had time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and teaches conductivity focused and tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that at waseda val dot com forward slash l. l. h. february tenth two thousand and seventeen in this episode three inspiration in this third
so that i hope to inspire you to want to be involved in the space of machine learning in artificial intelligence or lease to keep the very close by elements ai i think is the most important thing happening in the world right now curious and i hope that by the end of the spike s. absurd you'll see weren't coming from this is completely a philosophical episode it's a lot of fun and i wanna fluff so west you lose credibility in music teacher of mushy learning just know that this is the last of its car
i ain't related to some gory details of course starring in the next episode this was just for fun like this said this is all philosophical there are four sort of philosophical conversations are happening around the space of a high right now and talk about for lesser with the most successful which is on a mission of the economy as i pointed out last episode the definition of or official told since being able to simulate any intellectual task you can imagine the types of jobs that are going to be displaced once the icons and full
swaying in the dawn of the i. we rock we are the kind of expected to be very menial digital data entry type jobs tax preparation kind of jobs to go away that's not you know we didn't really think of that as a guide coming in and taking our jobs we thought of that as the digit decision on nation of jobs of simple jobs but more and more very high skilled intellectual jobs are being replaced as well as guys hitting the medical industry with a vengeance medical diagnoses a huge space for him
and sitting in radiology looking at trees and coming up with a prognosis well the action do that very effectively by way of something called convolution you'll know works for surgery is now being revolutionized by ai very high precision surgery robots are coming into the hospitals and the right now they're convinced the need for surgeons we don't know how long that will last for replacement at least theoretically of course cars but we're seeing right now already on the streets autonomous vehicles google solved
i think heart is in many cities already is in the news of people are discussing the implications discussing the economic implications discussing the philosophical and safety implications but right away you can imagine that taxi drivers and freight truck drivers are going to be impacted by it's the immediately in fact programmers designers and logo creators programming web web site programming for example this website called the great dot io which is has the goal of generating the website my way out of
the short haul jeans if you give us some specifications web design weeks has a module that you can have it design your cage around your haunted by way of artificial intelligence and as aria alone go generator and ai logo generator rather care remember the name of it but he does he even creativity is not exempt from the eyes and in fact talking of creativity music and art is already being generated by day and people having trouble distinguishing between human generated piece of music or art
a machine learning generated peace to their to natural response is suspect intimate takeover by ai one is sphere of robot to take my job does aware that on b. b. c. dot com that'll put on a show notes were you to look up your job to determine whether it's safe and the i. takeover to wanna find i think god nursing ranks up there is something that safer now i think it's because it involves a lot of highly unpredictable body motions were robot on the road salt driving a car falls very predictable set of rules
will the nurse running around in character words and ideas in rushing to and fro in answering doctor's orders molly sings this is something you can vary widely predict with robotics artificial intelligence one general response of the fear to the ai economic takeover is that if you look at all the prior economic revolutions in human history we've then okay there was the agricultural revolution which switches from hunter gatherers to farmers and people adapted for the better the risky in dust
roll revolution that automated a lot of hard work physical labor and the result of it was stronger economy were people could focus on things that are west menial and that is the information age of the you know the invention of the internet and everybody got on board the internet in new jobs were created even as the others were displaced so for example previously you'd call it travel agents to put your flight to destination while cool flights can give you your flight find the best price no prob
those guys around the job but new jobs were created in the information age such as what developers mobile out developers who didn't exist before that our economy is stronger than it was before so every harm every economic revolution does have a small impact is time potentially negative truck consequence on people who have the jobs are being displaced that is new jobs are created people are able to adapt their economy comes out better on the flip side is entirely differ
take his economic take over which is in fear with excitement people in this camp points to exactly what we're trying to achieve with economic animation replacement of jobs so that we can live more comfortable lives in the same way that industrial revolution replaced very hard menial labor will think about the more comfortable and safe white supported you living with fox honasan beagles writhing of surround and delivering free the money saved by all this on me she has to go somewhere and it's not going to the pot
of these robots see yellows were conducting meetings including a graph that are going up to the sky is shaking hands with other robots and laughing and having beers after work go to rio de asta robots are built to serve us so that optimists say that it's not to destroy our economy is to make life a lot more livable for us the new jobs will be created that we can participate in but we don't know what those mighty yet if you look at the result of the prior economic revolution wheel
with more like fiends after each revolution than ever before and that whole flynn was exactly about to come really do more keenly lives the way party would if they'd about the way we live now in the information age with our couches or t. v.'s or video games that we can all those go out and eat and persons net worth being bathed in a bygone era that they lived on the streets persons net worth being negative today is all too common to student loans must just because the wilderness stage with so much back now
leniency is provided to us in one way which he optimists think that this might hang out something assorted ingrid we discuss the multiple government's such as in scandinavia called universal basic income you b. i. where the government basically just gives us a minimum wage so how about battle would look into that u. p. i. so there you have it at the moment automation world is about to change under our feet by way of artificial intelligence and i don't think that there's anybody who disagrees with that
that section hold maybe a little bit less consensus that economic revolution in this next section of bout the senior weary in this part is really furnaces were put on my tin foil hat that we start to go down that philosophical rabbit hole into the void salome define the scene you larry the singular he was a term coined by burger binge and champions in recent times by guy named ray cruz while you're in here his name all watts so just a familiar with that name way kurzweil come back to him at that what is the singularly in athletics
scott of what he called seniority maybe the point of no return if you've got an exponential graf coming from the left and it's going to the right getting bigger and bigger going at another not any goes up into the sky into infinity the point at which it is clearly to me a break for it up into the sky is called the singularly at an exponential function melfi zoom into the grass me try figure out where that point is that it made a break for iraq to build find it because it does look like any point is substantially greater than the next by comparison to the prior difference
points but if you can assume back out in usa take a toy car trying to push along the grass from left to right to rule come up quick work of the front bumper car seemed to hit wall and that's the point we call the scene you weary so some say the human technology falls along this type of craft if you look at our economic revolution some prior section the agricultural lucian didn't assure revolution in the information age each revolution was closer to two previous want then no one was to its predecessor and higher up on that for
aft and right now we're coming up on what's called the intelligence explosion where are all mental work is potentially on readable by artificial intelligence now you might be thinking well that doesn't sound like it's going to infinity matches sounds like the next big hot on the graph figures were things change artificial intelligence is taylor towards specific applications medical diagnoses autonomous vehicles stuff like this the notion of artificial general intelligence where are you have the intelligence agent which can perform
all of these tasks generally any any mental tasks generally cross the border school artificial general intelligence borscht rong ai if you give it the task of sort of wanting our economy make your life squishy fantastic if you give it the task of making a version of itself that is even better at performing that jaw and then that's new child robot has one goal of improving our lives and the other goalpost making another version of itself it's even better
and it you know this is sort of evolution robot evolution what's called siddiqi i see the artificial and haul jets and sent it doesn't take twenty five years for robot to grow old and cons mala job out world as to the way faster at metal processing underscoring to inherit the knowledge of its prior generations you're gonna get a spiral sort of out of control of technological progress and that is a shoot up into the sky and that my friends is
singular did something that is the next phase of evolution humans effectively stopped evolution when they invented such effective medical science well the exponential growth maybe doesn't start and stop with technology with the dust bowl way back into evolution starting at cambridge explosion and must necessarily continue all the way past humanity therefore is almost are inevitable duty to create artificial intelligence so that evolution can continue this is all off on this craziness ray
i am promise on a talk about real technical details of machine running a future pockets of his award you inspired first there's some really relief on philosophy happening around why you should care about artificial intelligence we better not you can take your side after you've heard the arguments are right for the next section are you ready for this consciousness this one is near and dear to my heart i love philosophy and i love the philosophy of consciousness an interesting thing is that consciousness might be the last bastion of open saw
scientific riddles we found the alphabet of life in the genome we explored outer space and discovered the black hole in all these physical mathematical phenomena that were previously magic everything was magic or religious so for example at one point sickness bill must uphold why is what is now 'cause you're simply bacteria was an infestation of evil spirits back and it was magic and it was religion wealthy think about it consciousness is still the domain of magic and really
none but surely our brains of physical substrate of the minds of our brains follow biochemical laws physical laws of the universe therefore can't our brains be considered to be machines and if that's the case are our minds the results of the machine the byproduct of the workings of the machine that brings up into question the notion of free will do we have free will or simply are we reactionary to an environment is the human mind is the byproduct of the machine
and we're creating a computer brain which itself is a machine will the computer brain creates as a byproduct of computer minds this is a very deep deep rat hole up to date in the space of cognitive sciences carton of science incorporates philosophy neuroscience psychology and artificial intelligence always people these philosophers coming together debating whether or not in fact a machine artificial intelligence can be conscious was talk
bob words intelligence and consciousness when i say that a machine is artificially intelligent is intelligent if it is affected that performing it's mental task at hand in fact media calculators and tortured by that definition of a lot of people missing yes global haven't told us like humans have intelligence the civil case of human intelligence is superior to machine intelligence at present but you can compare them they're not apples and oranges intelligence is intelligence what you're thinking about what you have a debate in ma
and this consciousness is that computer experiencing the phenomena that it's simulating war that seeing the world in the case was solved driving a car court computing in our rhythm is experiencing these things and experiences called claudia in the world philosophy of consciousness that experiencing the things if you're religious and i'm sure you're you have your own conclusions about consciousness were conscious is basically quits the soul is called toulouse and sold separate from the brain
physical substrate separate from the by product in a substantial way during different dimensions that's called dualism in one of the biggest opponents of the philosophy of dualism was rene descartes well we've moved past dualism you'll really find very many philosophers and cognitive scientist who bullied into was undoubtedly than most likely mona's i'm which says the brain is the mind and some important way if so how does the brain create a mind a very prominent some field of consciousness philosophy is called funk
wasn't that is accepted today and the boiled down to this money didn't trouble for this but if it walks like a doctor talks like a duck it internally as experienced as being a doctor so for human express intelligent action that yours to stem from consciousness the robot expresses similar intelligent action then question mark this segue is effectively right into alan terrains test for consciousness which is called deterring tax if you're talking to a robot that you're talking to human doubles
when curtains in you can see which ones which any can't tell the difference that i think we've done its best called the terrain test so this is so far on the bed discussion above can robots be conscious can artificial intelligence be conscious and it warrants a whole pie cast series of it's own i'm going to point out some good resources at the end of this episode my heller recommended he in the real fun and finally the last big philosophical throw down in the space of any i evil killer role
what's so the big scare will they id inevitable we rise against us what most prominent books in the space is called super intelligent by nick bostrom and an example of his thoughts goes like this is called the paper clip maximus asian algorithm if you start utilizing am i had a paper clip corporation to maximize the production of paper clips and you don't specified not to destroy the earth in the process what might happen is that ai it might
find a way to achieve consuming all the resources of the planet in or to maximize paper put production the general idea goes but be careful what you wish for because you may not be able to specify all the constraints big fears liked you on mosque stephen hawking and bill gates got on board with this at one time and it became really big depress me personally i don't think that there's work for such a scare but i believe that you'd come cheer on conclusions by diving into the resources so here the resources the book missing you larry
smeared by ray kurzweil describes from the seal whole process of the singularly and this is colonel must read for anybody in ai it's very fine it's very fluffy ahmed snow not rigorously scientific but it's very easy read it in the space of consciousness and whether or the machine can become conscious breakers while also wrote a book called how to create minds that's also very good book my fear resource on consciousness is a video series by a company called the great courses and
the series is called philosophy of mind brain consciousness and thinking machines in this goes over all the philosophy of consciousness from the beginning until now including rene descartes in toulouse up in including artificial intelligence is who really really good echelon we're recommend and then there's another book on curly reading by a daniel denning who's a prominent modern philosopher constance called consciousness explains and when it comes the fear stuff is a book of course i mentioned called super intelligence by nick posture
and all these resources are put on my show notes and those c. d. v. e. l. bossi duval dot com forward slash pod casts forward slash machine learning with a hyphen forward slash three in the next episode were finally begun to tactical details i'm going to describe machine learning from a high level review and how it's broken down into the sub fields of supervise on supervisor reinforcement learning hope to see you then


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash m. l. g. eight i'm also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. february twelfth two thousand and seventeen mrs episode for our rhythms intuition
in this for that so we're finally getting get into the details of machine learning so let's recall how machine morning fits into the overall artificial intelligence puzzle artificial intelligence is broken down into multiple some fields such as reasoning and knowledge representation search and planning and then this morning and learning has its roots dug into all the other sub fields in each side filled you might perform action and then you might make a mistake in that learning from your mistake part
is learning some she learning is broken down into three steps infer or project error or lost schrader war learn were sick or in these these are synonymous words so infer or protect there are lots showing or learn so let's do an example we're playing chess in chess i might make a move my moved upon them let's pretend it immediately aitken know how bad that decision was all this is not the case but let's pretend
you need a liang know how bad was that move to the move itself was at production may production to make the move them and they'd move and in determining how bad that wise is called the terror or loss function which is step to the machine learning process error or loss function that girl lost function tells me how badly i did and then by a charade myself i learned from my mistakes so if my terror function said that wasn't really really really bad move
then i'm going to update my model what's called a model or get back to the dead by substantially reducing some numbers these numbers are called weights but if i made a good move then the or function my tell me to reinforce my waits good job selling for project girl was function in showing or learn so like i said when i use the word or it means that one or the other of these words might be used when you're reading attacks barker watching some video series
i'm just gonna start using one or the other word myself going forwards why my only use the word error function and some of los function so here shouted process a machine are usually works let's use an example the we're trying to predict the price of a house on the real estate market of portland oregon this is kind funny him shimon eagerness you wanna of commonly used examples over and over i call used hello worlds of mushy learning where the reference of dataset like a professor
or or textbook or on video series war reference some very common dataset such as the iris flower dataset or the portland oregon real estate market dataset so let's use the real estate example while we're goin to try to do is be able to predict that cost of a house in portland oregon given the number of circumstances so for example where is the house located how close is it to downtown where the number of bedrooms number of
affirmed square footage etc no way that the machine learning process works is that you typically fried schering your model by top loading a giant spreadsheet let's say one million rose one million houses in portland oregon where we already know the price of the house we blow this short algorithm so in machine learning there are many are rhythms dedicates you specific tasks so for example the next episode you'll see linear rig
russian is one of the best pop rhythms use for this exact type of scenario you get for your spreadsheet into your linear regression our rhythm for example hands that barbarism shrink its model it free train sort of it takes all these rose rolf rolf rolf role in trains and trains in trains and trains until it thinks it has a very good sense of what it takes to determine the cost of the house and pour le know
or in so that initial step this kind of like free trading but it's actually that's training that's machine learning that part of our whole three step process that we're talking about and then going forward now we can do that you have a train model is that you can protect the price of a house that you've never seen before based on your model and then let's say they knew the real state aged you sold his house to some young couple they haggled you down to you gave them that
christ came out of this machine learning our rhythm the predicted price and the haggled you down to thirty thousand dollars less you go back to machinery younger than you say dude when you try to embarrass mate was thirty thousand dollars last and so you tell him that it goes back and read trains its models so every move example going forward is another piece of the training step so at first phase of all blowing a spreadsheet and training your model actress retraining phase we mess
school training and in every newsstand everyone single example going forward you read train your model is called online learning okay so we use a few words here on going to tackle these words one by one when i say algorithm that's a piece of software written in python intense afloat typically rick talk about languages and framework some of the track is so but that's a very popular starring brown and she learning these days python and sensor flow and algorithm is say a hundred lines of hi
some intensive flow code which for example spells out the linear regression mathematical algorithm now when you piping your spreadsheets a million examples of houses that came with their prices high to them you're algorithm runs over those rose and crunches the numbers to determine what it finds in common with all these houses that really determines the cost in it saves that information on discord in the database
for in memory what kind of high to the hour proven itself in the algorithm plus the saved a sort of that distort pattern the combination of those two things is called the model to the model is the algorithm plus the pattern that has warmed now the spreadsheet a huge import into your algorithm it hasn't rose and columns you rose r v houses themselves house one house to house three house ford center the
homes are called features features or pieces of the house to contribute your production so for example number of bedrooms number of bathrooms square footage and distance to downtown each one of those pieces on the house is called a feature to the rose or the houses and columns are the features of each of those houses and then typically the end of the spreadsheet alas call on the cost of the house in the machine learning how
rhythm what will do is it will take out our last call woman we move it put it aside and then consume the rest of the spread sheet which is each house and all of its features no feature sort of deserved a pie cast episode of its own features can be multiple all types of information so for example number of bedrooms number of square footage those are numbers sodium numeral features that can be nominal features which is short categorical so is this house down to
al gore does it not rather than using distance downtown yes or no that's a phenomenal binary or you can say it except what types of animals cats dogs were birds that phenomenal feature that allows three classes in its features that are the most important part of learning process the algorithm determines what coefficient to put next to what feature and what you get is an equation to bash important part to realize the alta
rhythm will look at your role a single roa time this house has four bedrooms two bathrooms eight hundred square footage i don't know about houses so i'm always getting strong as one mile to downtown those are numbers of your numbers associated with each feature in the power of them what war earns is what number two multiplying each of those features by this is called in mathematics of coefficients in machine learning are proven
it's called all wait so let's say that the power than goes over all of your houses row by row by row looks all the features and determines that the best way to determine the cost of the house is multiplying the number of bedrooms by point three the number of bathrooms by point seven per square footage by point five and then what you get is a number so the things that the algorithm learns his blue waits for the kosher
chance that puts next to the features and the features or your variables x. y. and z. in algebra in fact algebra is a primary math love machine learning it's actually linear algebra that were confusing machine learning what linear algebra does is it allows you to take up onto the clayton's and stack them on top of each other and then soulful for all of them together that's exactly what you're doing when you pipe your spreadsheet inch
or operate on each row is basically not algebraic equation were the machine running algorithms learning the coefficients next to each feature the whole combination of rose by columns your entire spreadsheet is called a matrix in mathematics so your machine learning our rhythm is working with the matrix of features in order to compute a matrix of coefficients have urges them altogether boils them down to a single formula they can then be used
make a prediction for the cost of a house in portland oregon so that's very jam packed and we're going to be piecing this apart overcoming episodes so don't worry if he didn't understand this time through let's take it from the top machine learning is three steps in for slash verdict and there are we're lost function in the train slash lawrence that while we do is we will import a giant spreadsheet of a million houses from portland oregon and ball
all of their features weathered the number of houses square footage for distance downtown and bowl last column of the spreadsheet is the actual price of each of those houses the machine running out for them will take it rolled by rodin actually make a prediction which shot in the dark part of the hour them will tell it how bad it did for that one row how far were you off in that single instance that seat error function the air functional telly
one number or a vector of numbers on how far off you were free of production the machine learning our brother more than an update its coefficients or waits that's the training process or the learning process is that their function said you were off by a huge margin then it will substantially change its numbers if it was off by a small amount they will change its numbers by a small mouth and then now going forward we can make projections on new houses on the market that don't already have a price assigned to that
the machine learning algorithm we use this call to break its equation that has constructed make a prediction the numeric production we can give that to the buyers of the house and if we're wrong about that production we can tell machine learning our rhythm there was wrong by what amount using the terror function and it will read sure ain't it small and that's that's called on one morning okay so that's the general approach the machine learning is actually broken down at three categories of algorithm
it's supervise learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning supervise learning is why just described to you everything i just described shoot up until this point is actually fall into the category of supervise learning to supervise learning does is you traded with a bunch of information that spread sheet that you upload you trained on dana and you can train on da going for the point is that your training it's usual or training gets so
it's like to have a newspaper in your hand in your state evaded our bad dog based on whether it got a production correct or incorrect examples of this type of algorithm or linear regression in logistic regression so those are two types began wanted will give you for example on number outputs of the price of the house as one type of supervise learning algorithm what's called a continuous function so based on the inputs you get a number and another type of supervise learning garber
and will predict for you a class so is what i'm looking at a cat or dog or a tree or what unsupervised learning unsupervised learning as little bit different the machine will take your examples that the new rose the u. give it an adult toss it into a pin for example this is called clustering assad branch of unsupervised learning to cart put it in a bin but that dan doesn't have a class is not like i'm putting this ball into the cats category and putting this ball into the dogs
i worry i'm looking at the small ended its blue line connor turning around in my hand it's blue with little bit misshapen i'm actually does come up put it in his spin over here and i picked up a new ball this one's raddatz got spikes and put it back in over there but when the human asks me carved want calling these bins or why i made my decision to get really explain it is to set these balls over here have some something in common lot more common with each other then compared to these balls over and it's been
so unsupervised learning is the machine learning algorithm can figures out what is in common between this and that and segments portions of the day of population so an example of where are unsupervised learning might be used isn't user segmentation in advertising so i want to just german based on user actions on amazon dot com what the clicker one on what has that to show them these types of users poll showed that won him the sex abusers are walsh
oh that to the mass market segmentation supervise and on supervise lerner obviously the little bit different than each other but as a machine learning in junior ortega scientists in a professional setting you probably can be using a mixture of both these are rhythms on the day to day basis for your job they're different but they generally use the same types of mathematical equations and don't be afraid that your nafta commit should make a giant mine shift from one to the next on the other hand reinforcement learning here
as a totally different beast reinforcement learning to knead is where most of the fallen in the action is happening in machine running right now i consider reinforcement learning to be sort of the real ai in machine learning the stuff that makes you think is this thing thinking if the real juice and meet it's the stuff that the mind is most heavily involved in it's also the stuff that sort of reaches its roots into the field all of planning and searching and we
reasoning in knowledge representation each other fields of artificial intelligence supervise learning is really interesting because it applies to fields like vision that in speech you can imagine for example where you are training machine running our brief them on my quarters of dialogue and it learns kind of what makes sentence structure common from one sense to the next so that they can actually construct sense on its bone can have a conversation with you that supervise learning or reinforce
that learning is involved in taking actions taking steps so for example robots taking us that in an environment or artificial intelligence bad guy in a video game trying to figure out how best to kill you the way reinforcement learning works is that you give that goal was pretender we've got a mouse in the game may is trying to find she's at the end of the maze the goal is that she's at the end of the maze and then you give it to us
system of reward and punishment that's the reinforcements that so let's say that if it gets that she's sick it's a hundred points and if it falls into a pit of doom they lose a hundred points the reinforcement machine running out for them will figure out on it's own what are the rules of the game where the action sick intake and the best strategy to achieving its goal soap on like supervise learning were you the programmer sure amy arboretum which it with
bunch of degas in it warns the equation for what all this data has in common in order to protect the numeric value or class the reinforcement our rhythm warren's from its own behavior what actions to take an environment so reinforcement learning is sort of action oriented and get trains itself c. can see why this is the really juicy cool stuff now unfortunately i'm not very savvy on the world of reinforce that learning by match
we'll learning a lot of those algorithms myself right now but also saw field it presents itself to people who were just getting started in the world machine learning algorithms early on reinforcement learning is an advanced topic in machine running soap or not to recover reinforcement learning for a long while many many many episodes down the pike but just the kind of give you a general idea of how they implement these algorithms common algorithm icy these days is called deep tissue networks soon
uses deep learning machine running our rooms in order to determine the best course of actions course of actions is called a policy in reinforcement learning towards achieving that goal you give it negative points for certain things in a fireman and positive points for certain things a farm and kind of the key to the puzzle for making and it reinforcement learning our bread and salt puzzle quickly and effectively is this thing called before is lava basically every step the mouse takes in the maze
it is minus one and so if wants to get to its goal as fast as possible for us lot being alive hurts so i need that she's asap so those are the general principles of machine learning so starting from the top again this is all very hierarchical artificial intelligence by some field of artificial intelligence is machine learning the sheer learning is broken down in a threesome fields supervise learning unsupervised learning in reinforcement learning an indian each sob field of mush
in learning dark multiple algorithms so for example and supervise loring there's linear regression logistic regression etc and we're going to be in the next episode talking about linear regression sort of the wa no one hello world machine learning all right i'm gonna go on a tiny little break maybe three weeks envoy to put this pod cast series out on read it and some other places i just wanna see how interested people are in the series if i see law
with interest expressed them of course i'm gonna actually continue and i will do so and post haste the final ceylon vicious right away that i will continue but maybe all too little bit slower i want some feedback if you guys to go to see the valves are calm thwart slash pod casts forward slash machine learning and click on any episode airing go to the comments section or you can just e-mail me at tyler run ellie t. white alley or are you any yellow he actually no lock on with the feedback or no or these pike assets
as of the two rushed towards a two basic again my goal is to teach you machine learning anybody who was no mushy learning he doesn't have to come from a programming background or a mathematics background just let me know overall kind of how this approach is working for you if there's any suggestions or improvements that you have this forest resources for this part cast episode i'm a post an article by machine learning mash three dot com which is very good series of articles on introductory topics an issue
learning disorder of what this pod cast games to be black in oracle format and then it on voyager recommend the master algorithm master algorithms really good books it's sort of like this episode and potentially the next four or five episodes we're going to be spelling out the basics of some very fundamental machinery are rhythms of the reason i like it is it you can actually it's it's very introductory very accessible for new bees and it's also an audio format and envoy richard you're
demanding as often as possible audiophile or matt machine learning and mathematics resources because like i said in a prior episode the best way to learn machine learning history books and especially courses like the corsair a new jack city courses and would recommend later but having an audio supplementary backup resource while you're writing or cleaning or commuting grizzle lot of time in the data want people could learn some really valuable information from all
your resources is wasted so as often as possible and would recommend audio resources so check out that book the master algorithm and i hope to see you next episode


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash and algae it time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode five linear regression in this episode were finally did they get into the nitty gritty you're
first machine morning algorithm linear regression malice recall about machine learning that it's a very hierarchical feel starting at the top something i called mathematical decision making on actually know what they call the super field to be broken down into artificial intelligence statistics operations research control theory and some other fields artificial intelligence is broken on a machine learning this were we are and an owl is broken down into supervise learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning three go down the supervise learning rattle
you'll find this supervise learning is your bread and butter professionally and even maybe academically and in machine learning of course to be dabbling with unsupervised learning doesn't come up quite as often unsupervised learning where reinforcement learning is looking more like local ninety nine territory and i can see that stuff until end game so here we are unsupervised learning unsupervised learning can be broken down into two more such categories classification and regression so class of fires and regress years ache
last of fire is supervised learning how rhythm that will tell you the class of a faint so far look in that picture my looking at a dog or cat or a tree the classify wrote tell me what i'm looking at what class of things i'm looking at the regress sir will give you a number a continuous variable so the outflow of your regress your function of her supervise learning regrets are algorithm will give you a number one two three four five were not talk about classification in the next episode on logistic regression button
sadness over and talk about linear regression which is a regress are supervised learning algorithm to give you a continuous burial it is the hello world of all machine learning this is work everybody starts a linear regression everyone starts here even before this that they go off and specialize in vision or robotics or controls the rear something that's kind of level fifty we want walk class system everyone starts beginning the matter what your field is linear regression an example the ruddy you
in the near aggression is the exact example for the last episode with portland housing costs estimation that the linear regression example because you're guessing the cost new numeric cost of the house given features so recall we have a three step process in machine running projects figure out how bad you did which is the cost a quarter function and then learn from your mistake which is the training or fits that scene of fighting machine learning that this like ten words for any given word it's
synonym hell so the project face to be per day to or hypothesis or objective or estimate the error can either be an error or lost in the trains that needed to call learning or training or fitting were a number of things are probably in a siege ramos offered so all use that myself all let's start at the first step which is to make a prediction the way you make the production is by way of function called a hypothesis function or objective function and usually look
like either th with parentheses and backs inside of it and h. stands for hypothesis which are hypothesis function that x. is going to be your example cigarette put into it a house the house has remembered has features such as number of bedroom square footage number of bathrooms distance to downtown so packs actually gets broken up into x. one x. two x. three acts for the multiple features inside of the function side of the hypothesis function we take that acts that one row would break out into its features
and in the body of the hypothesis function is multiplying each of those features by a coefficients so looks like in algebraic equations so were you have is age of tax no p. h. with parentheses and attacks inside the parentheses equals fail one times x one thing it two times axe to fade if three times extreme cetera buffet has on sometimes old cease your w. four wait oracle fisher
if you talking to a mathematician coefficient those are the things that are in the multiplying by your features in order that the summit of that equation gives you your estimation your prediction so for example let's say that we wants us to make the house cost of the house that has a hundred square feet one bedroom and one bathroom while we want to learn the whole process of learning is learning the cold fish and the parameters the faded
don't you stop you for wait fate of fry ono the thing that goes in front of the x. value so why do we multiply the square footage by white times square footage quite tense eight hundred was blank times one for one bedroom was blank times won for one bathroom for lauren those blanks in going forward is to call them fade out now what i'm gonna do in order to make of this episode little bitty
here to visualize on a lot off all those faces except for one we're only gonna be working with one x. x. one which is the square footage of the house so we're it pretends that the cost of the house depends only on the square footage of the house obviously that's been accurate any fact if you are using very few teachers in your hypothesis function that you about that certainly be incorrect generally speaking up into appoints the more features you how
of the more pack your your outlook is good to be but just for visual is is sacred pretend that the cost of a house depends only on the square footage of a house so page with parentheses an axis side of it the hypothesis function equals fail one times x one okay so we're on the predicts that the murders of three step process to the machine learning system one is to make production one is to figure out how off you were an end want is to lower
earn so warheads you were at work make a prediction with our hypothesis function we're going to import a spread sheet of houses in portland oregon and their actual prices on market so remember every rosenhaus in every call is a feature of each of those houses we've walked off all the features but one so right now we just have one row one call one roll on homeworld tuskegee house one has eight hundred square foot house too has nine hundred square foot
then the second call on is gonna be the actual cost of the house what's called a label and before we go any further last shred of visualize what we're looking at here to riyadh that exit value which is the square footage of each house panel why value which is the label which is the actual cost of the house to have an axe access panel why access the x. x. is being featured the wyeth says being the actual cost of the house and why
we're gonna get is a scatter plot a bunch of dots can in the shape of a football works kiddie clout and it's pouring op in right north east so that's all a party of those roar houses with all their square footage and their actual costs gives us a clout the northeast wallwork shrine to learn is a hypothesis function that old santa lying right through the center of baffle all sold that hypothesis function won one with horrible
they planners will maybe be pouring down and write southeast would be the opposite of what we're trying to achieve a very good hypothesis function will shoot northeast right through the center of that football nephew think about the function of this line why equal status times acts that look similar to something you may have seen in algebra why equals m. x. plus b. point slope formula which is exactly the formula for all lying sloping
which is exactly what we're doing here we're trying to come up with a hypothesis functions creating an angle line that goes for most of our d. n. seoul looks very similar fate x butters no be blood on the flip side is an x. plus b. one slow formula okay so we can replace them with fade out and let's talk about this be parameter white is be in that point slope formula if you do recall for outclassed would be is called a pious it kind of shifts law and left or
right before even start slow be sued where is your lying cross over the x. axis where is it the d. n. n. n. that annexed it is tells it it's lopes left poland for equation we have h. equals fail one x. plus fate is zero best and your clue of them x. plus b. sago one x. plus three to zero worth it is europa is or pious parameter why is a bias parameter up my ass parameter is kind of like an average
we're starting around if you don't have any other information so what happened if we got a house that didn't have any data on the square footage well then square foot would be zero which would zero out that fatal one parameter leaving us fully with the bias parameter in other words what it's saying is why is the cost of the house if we don't know jack the cost of a house if we don't know anything in the portland market is gonna be average co
hasta la house in portland area maybe two hundred fifty thousand dollars now what is with like somebody asked you how much would it cost to live in portland you're saying hey it's anzio depends on where you are the numbers for foot in as towers across lubricant leak knowledge plans on the square foot on are not how much does it cost to live in porn fined two hundred fifty thousand are on that bias parameter is where you start if you don't have any information it's like the average in its worries
we're moving fromm was the start why you rather parameters sore newly your aggression hypothesis function is h. you fools sago one times x one was fate at zero okay so now that we have of visualization in mind let's return to our production step step one of the machine learning process and later aggressions biscuit was to do is to put these labels he's why values on one side of a flash cards right and to look at the other side before face
inside the flash credit says the square footage of the house is gonna make a random shot the dark guess it seems to know where to go see why does the sun and that is to look at eight hundred square foot house and corliss was a wound ten dollars and you're like ten hours through this house you don't say i'm not on what the costs yet okay build picks up the next card so that's why your response nine hundred nine hundred square feet feet on the back actually says two hundred thousand dollars
you can see these values yet goes through it makes a production for every house the ten our spy dollars three hours to go or seven hours what tickets to the ends not allowed to collect all the cards flip 'em over and all my gosh it's classes said mrs though most way off sold what it does now now is the costs that step to figuring out how bad it is called the cost function or the terror function is very simple function very simple formula
it's basically just the average of all this mistakes so the distance between its estimation white hat or paychecks and the actual value the label or why so h. minus why would one average always sort some auto revived by the number of examples battle of the mortar given this is actually a twists the puzzle we're actually going to some mop the square differences of the actual and production so the big production minus actual
old quantity square in the square doubles as an absolute value because you want positive and negative differences be canceling each other on this average twenty square some whole thing out divided by two am so we have to to to have a square and we have two hundred dollar he's come to play in great essential sooner did the main reason there there is so that we can take a druid hill c. n. that doll in order to visualize the cost function we have our hypothesis function on a table and x. y. graf
okay imagine attacks on a table in kitchen and without that football cloud above docks scatter plot dora moved to new table and on top of this table is up all so this is now the three dimensional graf we have x. and y. play it and i'll pull on top of it going up which is busy axis in the way we're in visualize our costs function is the x. axis might be fade as zero with a one the wire
axis obedient if it solicit x. x. is they zero and why axes to stay one hand the error is into the air so that some value of fear is zero and fatal won we have an error of one hundred for example when we plugged in our random shot the dark guess in the initial pass was coming on to flash cards gone through all the houses lunar gresham algorithms going to row houses and taking a gas and taking a guest he
c. was way off it had assumed some random values for fate is your own fate one just to start with so they can know how bad it could be on how bad a don is of value returned by the cost function and it is on that easy access that up and down axis it's in the bowl somewhere so that dots inside a global now we move on to the learning face what we want to do is we want to take that got to move it down again
to the very bottom of the ball with it here are two zero we wants right now that there is way high in the bowl the dot that we have with our faded parameters they wanted a zero the way they're set right now gives us a result way out here on the removable we want to take that dot we want to move it down the bull the way we do that is true process called greedy and descents and at last you learned your first
learning algorithm greedy and descent create descent uses calculus k. calculus to take to do with this of the cost function in order to take a step one step at a time take that dot and move it down the ball and so we found a place on the ex wife playing a buffet is your affair warm where this the value the cost value is minimize the bottom of the ball so how greedy and descent works is lie
this you take the jury evidence of your costs function where you are in the graph to your dots on the ball high up on the bolt you take the two rivers of that function with respect to that point is your thing about calculus would you read it tells you is the slope of your point in that function said he'd imagined taking a piece of paper and pushing against the doctor cotton that the polls really really thin pig
thins the dock to be either on the inside or the outside of the dust matter if you push a piece of paper against that dot the piece of paper has a certain slope like exploiting kind of downwards right really steep that is the tianjin line or the drone residents of your cost function at out what's the what it tells you is that you're doing really bad if you're slope is really steep it means you're very far from zero so what radiant as santa
is is this is says okay guys your needs take a big step on this a. twelve inches southwest twelve inches southwest so south let's say is they want and west to stay too so those guys change their number to change their number so you just ought to be due for a favor parameters that still learning process is changing your favorite foreigners learning your waits to that your function is now
more accurate and you can imagine what just happened on our hypothesis functioned as we actually just changed the ritual theta parameters there inside or hypothesis function imagine we'd member that football graf to scatter plot that cloud we have an x. and y. axes the other tables were left the week when we made our first initial production why old yes shot and dark it was really bad saying houses cost a hundred ten dollars and twenty dollars or wall
i mean maybe was pointing south east right the exact opposite of what we wanted to be which is northeast right down center of all this stout that greedy descent just took by taking it to riveted of the cost function in order to reduce to to minimize the value that cost function outputs by changing the face of parameters it's like grabbing are lying and rotating it counterclockwise one big step so great is set
now steps back and cycle okay i work in closer been close over the goods that he scratches this shannon says okay on that are to take another to read it here so we are nu theta planners and ways are new hypothesis function in our new cost function amin why don't you say in order to minimize your cost another step southwest last two and nineteen inches south and forges west so that's another generation
of the greedy and descends process so take sense that it changes they want any changes faded to smaller this time now or closer to the bottom of the ball in our cost function and are lying in our hypothesis function just rotated even a little bit more counterclockwise now why is actually touching some of the docks in our scatter plot from our original spreadsheet in grenada senses okay okay we're really close that really close now why you take just one more babysat i took
derivative have terminated such take one more babysat southwest's or faded parameters are outdated fail one gets as alteration fate to get some alteration our hypothesis function is changed and we are lying going right down the center of the football so great a descent has learned for us with the parameters that will give us the smallest error they call it minimizing the cost for minimizing the air traversing the ball in our paragraph all way to the bottom
the ball so that our hypothesis function is most accurate so that's kind of cool you actually see math in real life you're using the term rhythms of the function to murder figure route how big of a step to take in which direction to change your coefficients so that you now have a more accurate function this process of learning is also called function estimation because you're estimating the parameters of the functional give you
more accurate out what no one even note you never really get a cost function of zero in order for the cause function be zero all of our examples have to be exactly on our hypothesis function lying soul is slight wind your taxes one wise one axis tune wise to x's three wise to ask you know you never see than real world remember we elliot cloud it looks like a football and wine goes right down the center the air or does not see
we're out the error is b. squared difference of the errors of all the points to the line that we created which is someone or some positive number but what is right down the center it looks like it's just it's fitting the graft just sell them that there is minimized and that's the ideal place for or lying to be by the way mirror function in this case where it's the square difference at all
all summed up in the bye bye to him this is called the means squared error now real quick i'm going to tell you the equation for glory and descents can remember that gradient ascend is taking the jewelry is that is of the cost function carried the two ridges of the cost function and cost function one more time the cost function is your hypothesis your production minus the actual value so why hackman as wyatt's quantity squared all
all of those the sum of all those in your spreadsheet divided by two times am divide by two and and and is the number of examples in your training set now to take the jewelry evidence of a function you don't need to know calculus right now you can know some of the very basics there's some rules there some rules we don't actually have to go through this grieving process and it feels there's a power in front of a function you can just take the output in fines attracted by juanita the lift shrieks of
trade and that's the reason now we have these two zen there it to the bottom you too and by by two men added to it talks where well when you take a derivative of the cost function those that two comes out of five in the car cancel itself out while we get in the hands is this is that this is the great sex algorithm on say is your own equals what was before my yes alpha times one
over am times the sum of the differences why half months why so you to this that you took you had faded zero by its premiere tickets that in some direction by some amount that way at all flood variable is called the learning rate and i'm not to talk about bungling you'd spoil this in the details from the resources section fail one is fatal one so what was before minus all the time is one over am time
the samba of white hat minus y. times acts on at the feature in edo needs and remember that the cooking when you're not the other this is more for people who are just got macklin klein curious you're gonna learn all the details of this in the resources section on a talk about later okay so that was a whole lot of information lot of information i'm going to basically star from the top like to do this lawyer i'm sure you've noticed by now like to start to talk and do it all over again now
so we have all the pieces in place bless you all over again machine learning is broken down and supervise on supervisor reinforcement supervises the case in which you are training your algorithm with a bunch of david soul portland oregon housing costs sounds like supervise learning our room to me you supervise we have classification and regression regression is coming up with a number classification is coming out with a class like cat on a tree well portland oregon were trying to figure out a casa houses sounds
regression to me linear regression is the most fundamental machine learning our them whatsoever but also of course is regression algorithm for estimating a number stories linear regression we have three steps we make a prediction we figure how bad we did with our cost function and then we trained we learn how to meet fix that mistake in the protections that we have our hypothesis function every machine learning our them how
the difference hypothesis function the hypothesis functional change from our them to heart rhythm as well as the cost function that cost functional change because the hypothesis function is different but remember that the cost functions based on my boxes function and of course the training step for every machine running our remote change because taking the jury is another cost function will be different depending on the function in the linear regression model your hypothesis function looks like this
sure that's the polls fate is zero which you're biased forever with which tells you the average that you're working with it he didn't have any other information work with clients say no one times acts fail wine is your weight or your coefficient bigger trying to learn eternal learned by astronomers will you try to learn the fate of parameters and x. is the future that scanner commanded this function for every road we're lookin' that we make a prediction
the hypothesis function will call that production why hats and the initial patch of things will go through our spreadsheet one road time make a prediction make the production make a production random shot the dark reuse say one of fate is your new random values your year random results step to our cost function will tell us how bad we did howl far from the truth we were on average it's called a mean squared error
or in the case of linear regression and it is the average of the differences between or estimations and their actual values the equation looks like this one divided by two am times the psalm all of all the differences squared so page of x. minus why squared for every roll some ought to buy went to overrun cost function that tells us how bad
did on average as a function which puts us as i've got all bull if we we use greedy and descends to move that got down step by step by step to the bottom of the bowl to minimize the error in the air is a function of our fate parameters so we find that point in free space where our dot is at the bottom of the bolt we find what the values of faith is zero and feel want ma
or on the table such that that there are his minimize and now we have learned our hypothesis function buffet wanted fate is your parameters we now have those handy and we can make productions in the future in the way we visualize greed the senate is as moving down that cost function that old course the bond of bolt which is the same as changing the parameters of our hypothesis function so that we're like grabbing ahold
goal line which was a bad random shot dark initially and chino rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise and tell it fits that they sat most effectively that point at which the error function is minimize the lever be perfect but there is definitely a point where that error is minimal our rights the savvy amongst you will recall that something is missing here something is missing is that i have worm
of all the features but juan i have reduced our situation to something called you leave the area it's linear regression one variable one feature which is the square footage of the house but that's not how linear regression works mo while of course yet many features the number of bedrooms a number of bathrooms the distance to downtown whether it's in a safe word dangerous neighborhood etc will determine the casa house all things considered and then of course the bias parameter
which is basically the start cellmark average that we're working within this in this housing market with multiple variables to multiple features we're dealing with something called mole most liberia linear regression and it's basically the same as ye very linear aggression but it's more difficult to visualize your mind i'm describing it's you and audio som actually not to go into the tactical details of multi very linear regression it's so similar to ye very at that making the transit
when you see the details on line you'll you'll you'll understand right we'll be alone a fascist basically our hypothesis function as did the age of vexed people's faces europe was fatal onetime sex want was fated to time sex to cetera we're learning all of favor parameters through the greedy and descent process but not to describe the mold siberia to linear regression model t. u. instead i'm going to point you to do resource though reaser
says section of this pod cast boils down to one resource one resourceful on it is the andrew being corsair of course andrew angie being corsair as c. o. u. r. s. p. r. k. and if you've been around the machine learning community for longer than a month that you will have heard of this recommendation a million times over stat overflow and cora and read it and wherever you may hang out this is
most recommended resource for getting started machine mourning period is of course so soon online courses beside a twelve week program or something you can go really fast self case i finished my name three weeks but more than recommending it to you i require all be used to take this course this is the most essential starting around for picking up and she learned if you start trying to learn she learned from any other resources you're not enough
have enough the fundamentals in place i read very many books i started reading textbooks are washoe wanted you to video series of listens to audio books and pod casts were ours for starting to learn machine learning i had heard this corsair course towered over and over and over and i avoided it because i'm not because i'm typically like to learn from luke's m. l. o. c. 's all what stands for these online courses i'd rather learn from a book so i avoided for awhile what he's a big mistake because my finally
hunkered down and took the course it's just hold the kearns and i saw everything for what wise and i slapped my forehead and i said why deny it wait so long to take this course enjoying it is the best teacher on the planet for machine running back course has you doing programming exercises in our lab and quizzes and tests again itself paste and there's great visualization spin the videos if the course equivalent of what i'm trying to achieve with this pod caseloads copley
one oh one is gonna be using a lot of mass that he teaches you the math along the way like essay in the introduction of the spot cast with audio being inferior medium injured beings course is far away that sip your your medium school learning she learning so i'm not recommending it's you i am assigning it's you and requiring that you start there if you haven't already taken and looting corsair of course don't fool yourself and thinking you don't have enough time for that you'll do it when you do have more time a new law
it's just to twenty minutes a day even ten minutes a day itself case puts it super facets pretty easy and you're gonna wanna search it away at it now sooner than later so that you prepared for the good stuff what search for all along like people earning in return on our stomachs are talking about all acted stuff additionally in cases like this episode i'm not going to be posting show notes with the algorithms and actually kennedy posting andrew beings show notes i'm going to direct you to the core sara page
she was the notes from his courses billing sergei did their authentic into you'd have to create new count on corsair first before you can access is links the better today and tomorrow anyway it back outside outside of the class in get started so that's it for this episode the next episode is gonna be on logistic work ration which is a class of fire version of supervise learning if you haven't already yet pleased to give me your reading on itunes you're stitch were brutal play or think everybody from the right key beauty
you came over and subscribe so we got some subscribers and i'm definitely going to be moving forward with this pod cast i hope to do an episode every saturday or every other saturday without gonna get special down on p. b. s. and loop see you next episode


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash famine belt he had time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like tax and he just conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that at waseda val dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode six certificates ten degrees so despite guess episode is to be at all why
fourth year of them alaska realize that the last episode was really heavy really really have the mathematics in our room staff don't wanna give you a break from that episode before move on to logistic regression i may do this from time to time in between very technical episodes trod upon showing them with fluff see gilligan of a breather this episode i wanna explore what are the options for you as summary pursuing machine learning whether you want to get to the industry professionally or you want to
ooh go down the deep rabbit hole as a scientist and cracked the mysteries of artificial intelligence and consciousness or whether you're just doing this is a hobbyists use curious about the whole thing working nights and weekends maybe just on side projects one reason that i want to address us right now is in the previous episode in the resources section i recommended that you will start on the intruding corsair of course in wallace not a very difficult course is a bit of the time to men minutes something like twelve week course i guess said itself tasty could probably finish it
read for weeks if you dedicate urso for the some people may be wondering if i may want to go back for a master's degree in the machine learning or to woody's you das began a degrees should i take that tangerine corsair of course now or do you wasted time sunday learning accessed from scratch anyway so let's approach the types of people learning machinery so we can answer this question the first type of person would just be doing this for self codification they just are playing around with machine learning as a hobby for side projects and for fine i think using my typecast
as aids curriculum for syllabus to help guide you in your own self motivated education would be plenty sufficient for that kind of person in the resources section every episode i'm going to be providing you see quite chilly the best resources for learning the details so early on in the series like i said i'd recommend intruding corsair course as long as the new g. busy for the next for six weeks highly highly recommend resource and enforce the end of my tie cassie resented be recommending things like artificial intelligence amar approached
x. book and indeed learning book i think for the self learners coming up with your own curriculum or letting me guide your curriculum albee play sufficient then there's people what's happened to the industry professionally and one actually speak to right now is on middle ground between those two types of people on the one hand we have people who are just doing this for fine and then the next wrong we have people who won it's happened in the industry and they wanna have eight and one have very strong resume some more right in the middle we enter this world all of what's called me
books and volvo c x it stands for massive open up online courses in there some major contenders in this field one is corsair another's an ex con academy in you dasa be so let's talk about these one by one con academy is for actually for high schoolers and cut a piece duties were very early college so the courses are offered on con academy of things like calculus statistics leader algebra would actually be very useful for machine learning education but i don't think
they're gonna have anything specifically for machine running so it's all the prerequisite stuff in a future episode gonna have on math there's branch the mathematics their recommended prerequisites for learning machine learning i'm going to make shouts con academy they're not useful for the purposes of this discussions we move on to the next one and acts doll i see a lot of discussions on read it and hacker newsom people are talking about whether these nukes are worth their salt and unfortunately that x's never won a kind of makes the cops never really a contender in these conversely
it's hands whether or not this is a good approach given that day that and we use that as a telling it evidence that may be bad acts is not one of the better platforms for learning to a science or machine learning so we're just going up to start at x. ers come up with the matter the equation the two contenders that i see in luke's most commonly are corsair at n. yu dasa the course sarah tends to be more recommended for one off course is that you offered these nano degree competitors sir
to check it's called specialization it's corsair specialization such as specialization indeed is science and machine learning etc but i find that people don't gravitate words arose or recommend them alive on social media course sarah is fantastic for one off course is like the man who being course intercourse or you'll see corsair courses recommend it from time to time but they tend to be worn off courses i think in my own experience looking at corsair it's a little bit less professional model little bit less in
history backing and post production by comparison to you daft city it's a princess you jack city new jack city has one off course is as well free course the u. take very good ones like the deep learning course that was put out by google they also have this thing called nano degrees their certificates the concur on line you pay two hundred dollars a month i think they tend to be about wanted to your programs these men are degrees the sensors stipulation waikiki finish it and utah
i mean you get half these men are degrees of very professionally put together a video series with mentors assignments programming assignments in class projects and solid pure it here interaction i absolutely think the huge assay is the future of online education in education in general i really think that moves or we're going to be revolutionary in education space i really hope that moves eventually kind of overtake the requirement for
are accredited university degrees because these are scale bowl professionally made manner degrees certificates put together by the best the best industry like intervene in sebastian to ron wyden however that presents these nana degrees or not widely accepted recognize or respected by employers now this is hearsay this is my own opinion you may wanna get a second opinion about this night you plan to revisit this pie cast episode feet
or what i've learned a little bit more about the space i plan to come back and redo this episode but from my own findings from talking to recruiters personal aide for reading hosts by recruiters are hiring managers on various social media websites it seems to me that you jessie anna degrees are not respected in the industry yet it master's degrees or of course accredited degrees there respected by corporations but you jessie entered
griese or not what they do do for the candidates whose applying to job is to provide you with your portfolio of projects that you have built for that class and they prove that you have the motivation and self drive to take an online course and it's a nasty to finish on line course i have seen hiring managers recruiter say that they very much respect the initiative shown by people who take these courses in the side projects at dave to
oh it's during the course of these men and agrees with that banana degree itself is not respected in fact it would cost that portfolios mentions y. c. hiring managers recruiter say time time again it is that portfolio portfolio portfolio portfolio is the most essential ingredient to getting a job and in industry having a strong portfolios projects you've built nights and weekends not just little dinky things they can recognize a cash from an image some
in the scales something the u. deployed to the dead u. s. steel horizontally and shows that you have skin in the game in developing large-scale machine learning projects to less likely you das eternity in between somebody who's a hobby us is somebody who wants to get a job because it feels the hot is because you'd be learning all the good stuff you wanna learn from these mannered agrees to this day helps you get a job in the sense that you are the shows that yourself motivated
and spew have a strong portfolio their degrees self doesn't help so what i would recommend for somebody who doesn't have the money or for and for people actually listening my pike s. security was in my part as shows do you have self motivation now if that you could follow up with the resources that idea of the end of each episode sort of a homemade curriculum merciless for you to go by you can teach yourself everything you need to know anything work on your own side projects on earlier that you whether or not you want to pursue
banana degree by way of the gas city or few just wants are working on some top side projects on your own in learning of the need to know from these books and videos me personally and i don't plan on getting a new jack city nana degree okay so now we're now we're in that mule categories people who are doing this because they wanted job like i said at the portfolios most important piece for getting a job and machine running for talking to recruiters are hiring managers this is sort of the way that wet development is
today's generation him in wet developments you'll see a bachelor's of computer science was is a minimum requirement on the job description that apple cans with a strong portfolio can kind of bypass that's that i often kind of you that bachelor's degree requirement on wet development jobs corruptions as a suggestion i do have a bachelor's in computer science so i don't know how much that helps public education is never talked about in an interview only might have passed projects similarly i've heard from people that
the master's degree requirement on a job description for and she learning job can sort of be bypassed if he have a very strong portfolio to focus on that portfolio but if you do want that peace of mind and black shirt edged the master's degree is in that actually accredited degree by comparison to death c. n. agree which is simply a certificate and will get you in many doors that you wouldn't otherwise get into now master's degree to be very expensive forty to sixty thousand dollar
some universities that there is one master's degree out there that is on line three on line is by george attack is called a pole and asked c. s online masters of science in computer science in eighty seven thousand dollars slowed substantially cheaper than you typical master's degree in the way either stand works i'm not entirely certain i believe they use you das city courses in lieu of certain classes it may just be even the u. death
c. d. n. a degree disguised as an accredited master's degree i'm not sure but i do know that your partner with you cassidy and you're using at least some new jack city courses in their program so i think they're able to drive down the cost of their degree because of because they're benefiting from the infrastructure the new jack city provides me personally when i think i'm going to do is start working on some personal projects nights and weekends to deliver shrunk portfolio so they can put in applications to companies if i find that
not going very well then i will call that pledge look like this poll and masius around the arterial secret now guys have worked professionally in machine learning for time but i was sort of grandfathered into the position so i didn't confirm my way there that's why i say this episode as little bit opinion based based on things that i've read it from conversations rama wedding conversations i've had with recruiters but you may wanna get a second opinion on some of the stuff okay p. h. d. why would you want a phd
don't you stay is not necessary for getting a job machine learning is not necessary masters it's twenty sufficient and in some cases you can bypass that masters requirement by way of very strong portfolio so why on earth would you want a p. h. d. l. phd well obviously get you into more doors like a machine mining engineer role at google or facebook some of the more hardcore basements artificial intelligence development rolls by find that most people would you go further phd that's not why they're doing it there now
doing it to crack in the industry they're doing it for the sake of the phd itself the thing about industry is it your job is going to be prescribing to you the types of projects you were gone and the nature of work in the industry tends to be a little bit boring i'm talking about right commander systems like amazon's rector manner system or anomaly detection programs for some very simple charts and graphs sort of d. n. a. analysis kind of gigs you working in machine learning yes we don't
really have the freedom to explore all the greatest need be greedy rabbit hole science it's going on in the realm of artificial intelligence and discussions are happening around consciousness and the future all itchy of modern research in ai going for your p. h. d. in mushy learning or artificial intelligence affords you that time to die a deep into the stuff that makes am i fine if you see yourself as a mad scientist who wants to solve these real
is that a phd is free okay now teach the program he's you on one of you know this your master's degree you pay for your master's degree seven thousand dollars for the onus c. s. program was to get into a phd program they pay you now they pay you about thirty thousand dollars that by comparison to a hundred and sixty thousand dollars that you might be making in industry in machine learned so it's kind of a compromise your jews on one hand to like get to work in all the really
cutting-edge research in all this fun stuff and a thirty thousand dollars in the d. working eighty hours a week or your work an industry where have the decent work life balance the very high pay scale but the kinds of projects i'm working on are less likely to be very entertaining on average assets compromising your behalf to come to terms with me personally i'm going to try to crack in the industry first by way of a strong portfolio if that doesn't work i'm going to get my man
stirs to greet them voyager reevaluated be three years now no-one whether i wanna go for my phd they definitely see value in the phd program really those hard questions being tackled by the scientists is very appealing to me some relieve the decision up to you if you have any experience or any questions or round this topic please calm in a shot at you if you get some discussion going back and forth maybe some more concrete evidence one way or another i'm going to pose some other conversations
i've seen from around the web in the resources section and let you conjure wrong conclusions as it for this episode and the next episode will get back to the technical details with logistic regression


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash n. algae to get to i'm also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and he just conductivity focused and tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode seven logistic regression in this episode work and talk about classify
years namely the logistic regression crossfire algorithm to remember where we are in the artificial intelligence treat we've gone down to machine learning down to supervise learning unsupervised learning is broken down into two sub fields classification and regression we studied regression last episode with linear regression which will give you a continuous variable outlet on number so the cost of a house in portland oregon an hour we'll talk about class
haitian which will give you the class of a thing in my looking at a cat and dog a tree house or the case of binary classification is this a dog yes or no zero or won that you may have noticed right off the bat the word logistic regression that is really confusing kiwi i said that supervise learns broken into aggression classifications of those are two separate categories now are talking about logistic and linear regression of both sound like regression to me how was logistical gresham classes
occasion actually the term which is ration it is historical it was a mistake i believe more effort schweitzer the nordic you can effect it has regression in the word logistic regression i think what's going on there is that associate it weep high or linear regression all over them into our logistic function so the classifications that is a function of our linear regression algorithms i think that's why regression isn't it
i know it's like we're doing logistic thingy too linear regression logistic regression and what is logistic mean well what cons out of our classification function is what's called a large it l. o. g. i. t. swelling to imagine this way linear regression is for guessing numbers with the casa house morgan and logistical gresham is for guessing classes this that or the other thing and why you do imagine logistic regression is like this machine with this car
tuned machine with conveyor belt going into a nightmare ball coming out of it and so incomes are linear regression our rhythm and it goes down a conveyor belt was inside and of our logistic regression machine mikado that cartoon like whoa ball being bang boom it looks like the fight going inside logistic russian machine and our palms a number which tells us how confident the augur that is that thing we're looking at his house or how confident is that the thing we're looking at is a tree so our common these now
or is associated with the class in these numbers are called lodge it's so point seven percent probability of this in-house point five percent hitting a tree point three percent in the dark and then we take this thing with the highest lodge it with the highest probability and we take that class that function of taking the class of two with highs lodge it is called order max you'll see this in various machine and libraries or max be or g. m. t. x. says fine thing with the highest number take that
class now all the random side you'll notice a set point seven percent likelihood of house point five per century point three percent on where are those all add up to one right to know at two hundred percent of us are real probability distribution it's not a proper probability if your architecture needs a proper probability distribution venue titles lodge it's so we're going to another machine the type of lodge it's been to something called soft max soft max best go past he
at apex it takes your lodge it's an it transforms them into a proper probability distribution where all of your logic to add up to one will cover soft maximus up so cover that the lawyer up some so logistically regrets and takes into its linear regression and then it does bing bang boom in the machinery in and out calms lodge it's one two three four large it's maybe we have before class system either this picture can be of the house the tree and dark or a cat and each lodge
it's associated with each class comes out of the machinery and we picked the one with the highest value in this case house with point seven by way of a function called apart max know like that in the last episode were made the episode simpler to visualize by working with you leave very it's linear regression rather than malt side very linear regression and i'm just assuming that you're going to take that into being corsair course where you'll learn the details of malted very linear regression and make
this episode symbol or by working with binary classification so is this picture a picture of a house or not yes or no zero or wind so incomes a picture bing bang boom outcomes one lodge it's been stated the valley between zero and one where's your represents no and when you represent yes so unlike the point seven which is the logistic regression our them telling us that it is seventy percent confident that this is a picture of a house is not a hundred percent confident said
the present hofmann the warrant do with logistic russians say anything over point five is yes anything on your point five is known so this is a yes this is a picture of a house which the guest of the picture my house okay well the example that we're gonna be using actually for this episode is the same example for the last episode we're putting in a spreadsheet clubhouses in portland oregon the rose or the houses themselves each call mom is off
it sure so square footage number bedrooms number of bathrooms distance downtown and center on the last label from a previous episode was the cost of the house two hundred thousand dollars three hundred thousand dollars that's why or labels that last call numbers called labels will why values the actual cost of the house and renewed using the spreadsheet to train our model reuse the spreadsheet to train the pattern that we recognize
so that in the future we can make productions will again logistic regression is non linear regression are guessing in number were guessing of class is so in this example reduce instead of saying the cost of a house which is a continuous there was now we wanna work with let's say and do we consider this house expensive or not yes or no expensive or not expensive says euro will be not expensive and one will be expensive as sole goal to spread she ourselves manually anything less say over free
a thousand dollars will consider that expensive anything under three hundred thousand dollars for considerate not expensive for him on fire spread sheet we're not open up in microsoft excel one road time and say zero one one one zero zero zero one one one zero zero one one one zero just replacing always actual numbers with whether or not we consider it expensive so we're working with classes here in this case binary classification it could be one of two things now remember how the machine learning system works we have a freeze
that process for takes to warrant for sept one step two is our bureau in los function and step three is train or learn soaring up high tenor spreadsheet inch were logistic regression function as to go through all rose row by row by row and to make all winter productions a bunch random shots in the dark that step one predicts phase in then steps you remember we're in use in error was function under function in order to that
erman how bad we did help off were weak and then we're gonna do step three which is to train our hypothesis function we're going to train these fade out parameters the coefficients in our function for that update our values and so we have a function that fits ortega accurately all wine autograph that's it started accurately now it's not to be aligned in the case of logistic regression so let's die even let's open up that machine
cartoon machine and zoom in and let's look at these three steps in detail so the hypothesis function in lyric ration we remember we had to scatter plot cloud of dots looking like a football pointing north east we wanted to shoot all wind straight through the center baffle all its quarter or progression line and linear regression or not to have numeric values in our case in logistically gresham were not an america is renowned ones and zeroes so on
one side or things that are expensive based on some combination of the features of houses and on the other side are things that are not expensive so we need a function that somehow gives us zeroes or winds were somewhere in between and our linear function of the tal y. one on the football cloud northeast that does not give us one or zero it gives us a number two hundred thousand three hundred thousand so the function we're going to use is a mathematical function and statistics it's called loses
function logistic regression the logistic function or received more a function in the recent callie signori function as an alternative to logistic function is it looks like an ass imagine if you take an ass you draw an s. and eat with your fingertips you grab that hot right hand of the s. and the lower left hand and you stretch it out you stretch it out so that on that x. equals zero on the x. axis coming from native city commission left you come from left from the left hand
and once you get towards the wire access to start for irving up really fast you cross over the wire axis at x. people's zero point five and one half and then when x. is positive you start leveling out and then you get to x. equals one up and you go to the right towards infinity so to guess on a graph the bottom of the ass is on x. equals zero the top is on x. equals one shoots off to the right word infinity towards the west towards infinity
crosses over the wire axes and zero point five two we wanna fitness s. curve this signal we function or logistics function we won a fifth part did in the grass on how to that function well we want to do is create what's called a decision boundary that puts all the data on one side if it's yes and all the data on and on the other side it's no more learn what that decision boundaries where we
crossover the yes no access door to train our fate of parameters remember that's from berlin linear regression episode we have these fayette parameters there are numbers inside the function that we're gonna learn what traced a tremor so we get this good decision boundary so that's our hypothesis function or our objective function it is the sick boy or logistic function so remember hypothesis or objective function is the name for the function they were you
the meeting the predicts that step one and depending on the machine learning algorithm you're using for the task at hand that function will be a specific function in math so in this case and logistic regression it is the signal you or logistic function in linear regression i don't i guess so when your function i guess i saw you call it what you call in sicily your function now let me just give you the formula for this function the formula for this ignored function it is one that bowl
we're one plus you to the native linear regression scum weird right so why not over one plus speed to the native of and we see see where c. is your linear regression function or specifically faded transpose acts when faye that is the vector of parameters that were no learn were weights and x. is the matrix of examples your spreadsheet if that transpose word her
you off that's the technical details of the multi very it's linear regression step that ice get in the last episode we're gonna learn that indeed andrew being corsair course so you'll learn this whole staff with factor is asian and matrix algebra and all that stuff and andrew being course so don't worry about that right now one more time logistic regression function to give you that s. curve on a graph is won over one plus speed to the native faded transpose acts
so linear regression is inside of that logistic regression function okay so step one is we have our hypothesis function and we're not tie dinner spreadsheet and ramat all our graf we're going to make up one to random guesses remember that step one is to predict predict randomly soul regulate yes no no yes no no no no yes yes yes yes yes with the actual values are no no yes as a no no no yes as i am warner do is it now rigorous step
to which is figure out how off we were how bad word that's our error or lost function and just like is that one where are our hypothesis for objective function is the d. a specific function depending on the machine learning our rhythm you're using our cases logistic work signori function in this that or error function will be a specific function as well ours is called the law that likelihood function because it uses all log rhythm in the function and here's how it works
we can't use or linear regression error function because we're not working with numbers were working with binary classifications zero or one when the actual value is one of my guess was zero how bad did i do or vice versa my guess was zero the actual values one habit of you or if the actual value was one and guesses one how bad idea fast case that there should be zero if i'd guessed correctly the error should be zero and remember that we're using lodge it's a steal things you're us one way
or anything below zero point five is known anything about zero point five is yes we may have guessed and our projects that points to as in i am twenty percent confident that the answer to this particular case is no where the actual answer was yes in that case were last wrong then if i would've guessed zero in the actual answer is one so our terror function is what it is if this law the function it started zero and those chords infinity why
people's infinity backpacks eagles won so those open up another nothin' happened to infinity cell or look and act in our error function is it a graphic starts its zero and it goes right ports one and off into infinity often to why equals infinity before never hits x. equals one the closer my guess is too wide equals zero which is the correct value to close my guess is to zero the closer to zero in
as the error and the closer my guess is to wine even though the actual answer is your own the closer to infinity is my care or ok this is very confusing and don't dwell on the details you'd been warned us on the corsair of course i'm just describe needs you now for fairness now let's take the other example photograph in the cases where the house is considered expensive been here so that their function works the closer my guest go score
juan in other words i guess that house is expensive i guessed correctly the closer i go towards won the graph pecans zero in other words the error is europe and the closer my guest goes towards euro where i'm guessing that house is not expensive but you know is the closer or my terror on the wire act says goes to infinity so this one's like a sloping grass in the other direction so it's like you're coming down from a lamp on the y. axis
c. n. you hit zero where x. equals one again i know this doesn't come out well in audio format so just dive into the details in the danger being course by just wants that you through the process okay so that's the visual representation of the cost functional were constructing for our objective function course ignored function the cost function looks like two separate cases of all locker room organic combine those two separate cases into one for
action and what happens is that's one of these gets canceled out depending on whether we're dealing with a yes or no hard to describe what the function looks like is why it's crime scene log rhythm of your gas was one minus y. times larger than a loved one minus your gas okay that's the error for one roll of your spreadsheet one guess how bad did you do guessing for one particular wrote some all those out into
bite them by the number of examples so it's the average all the errors in this case is so will the complicated what we're working with water rooms but just go to the journeying course notes for week three of a clue how was crazy set too was to figure how bad we did with all our yes no yes yes no no no guesses how bout were we ought to remember the point of our cost function is to tell us how bad we did so that we can srinagar hypothesis function we can shrine
in the fate of parameters to get up there graph that more accurately depicts the way things are with all of ortega and that's that's three step three is to train our hypothesis function using the park error function okay so our hypothesis function goes into art error function or you or is it the function at all of our hypothesis and then apart error function goes in shoe or train function name
ingredients decent remember gradient decent the function of gradient descent is to take to do with that love your loss function the two revenues tells you which direction you need to step with all of your faded planners which direction it each day the parameter needs to change maybe some native value or some positive value down laughter right and by how much surge rivers says how much you
should your favorite parameters in your hypothesis function needs to change in order to reduce your error function and we're going to keep doing that one ingredients that the time keep taking the derivative and changing your fate of parameters until our error function is at a minimum at the smallest point that they can be so he hypothesis function goes into your error function and your pair
function goes into the directive function remember that the derivative itself is a function and you repeat that to resist that one step at a time until your error function gives you what the small value the smallest value that they can give you which means your hypothesis function going back once that now is ideal in our case it means that our signal it function has a good decision boundary they can separate all the yeses on one side and all windows on either so
and and then in the future when you make a gas with the new house you've never seen him you don't have the label is this house considered expensive by our relative definition of expensive it will throw around my craft and if our function gives us anything it greater than point five than the answer is yes and it gives us a lesson for fighting answer is no okay so gradient ascent trains your fate of parameters by taking the drool riveted of your loss function which tells c.
you how big of the steps taken which direction over and over and over until your error is small and the gradient descends formula is for each of your fate for amateurs you have your fate brown or what was before minus also over am times the sum of all both your guests minus the actual value times that feature in that position so they j. people stage a myself over am
the song from my equals want them all of the hypothesis for that role minus the actual value for that road times feature j. for that role again you'll learn this unit and routine corsair course all man that was wild and so let's run through this one more time remember we have supervised learning broken down into classification we're we're trying to guess the class of a thing is it kept our country and regression which is where we're trying to guess the value of a fee
in the continuous variable or numerical value within an end in sight of classification you have any number of our rooms such as the decision tree or appeasing crossfire we're focusing in this episode on the one oh one class of fire which is called logistic regression logistic regression takes a spread sheet of dia whose values were labels hawaii call 'em is gases and those zero one zero zero one one zero zero one in the case of binary caught
the vacation in the case of love malt psych class classification he will be any number of classes were not to talk about that mess up so we hike that spreadsheet into our logistic regression algorithm logistic regression algorithm goes all over that spreadsheet and makes a whole bunch of gases that step one is predicts that to his determine how bad he did with those gases and step three is to take your ear function from set to an op client repeated applications of
the door resident of that function to tell you how much to change your hypothesis function faded parameters so that you can get more accurate and more accurate overtime and sell your error function finally reaches a minimum value now you have a hypothesis function that is trained on your p. l. o. and spreadsheet or your matrix and now when you get new samples in the future you can pipe it into your hypothesis function and it will give you a guest now
castle be more accurate details of each step is that the hypothesis function in our logistic regression our rhythm is called a signori function or you logistic function inside of that signori function is actually linear regression so logistic regression is a function of all of linear regression autograph or logistic function looks like it that's a stretch out s. and we're trying to find a decision boundary that put slowly yeses on one side no one knows all
one side or there are functioning step two is called paul lot likelihood function and it tells us how often we work with or gas from the actual value and the function is actually quite complex so i'll just refer you to the intruding course to look at the equation into watches videos to understand the equation but in summary just tells you how daddy did and of course the trading status supplies repute applications of the derivative of los funk
and in that luke doing repeat applications it's called greedy and descents were descending that paragraph to the bottom of the graft were that error is below its that's what's called the censored sending now let's sort of take the ferry big step back and remember what we're trying to accomplish image artificial intelligence the very general sense of the term remember that artificial intelligence is being able to simulate any mental tasks now we'd go
down the details rabbit hole of linear logistic aggression talking about mathematical equations and graphs and charts and the training process ruble learning process was like taking these law names or these ask curves in all three men in some way that says you probably feel like you're very far removed from artificial intelligence by now so let's take a big step back and let's remember the goal simulating a mental task remember the artificial intelligence is broken down to multiples
fills one of which is machine learning and i said machine learning is sort of them the most interesting in essential in my opinion sobbed field of artificial intelligence in that it affects all the other fields it's almost like any mental tasks could be boiled down to learning boiled down to storing up pattern about how the world works city you can make a protection in the future and inference eleanor
samples were restoring a pattern or a model of the costs of houses and portland oregon that doesn't feel lot like artificial intelligence yet or whether house is expensive or not yes or no logistic were linear regression at the pattern and then we can make a prediction was that pattern in the future but if you step back a bit and think about other more high level sorts of machine learning tasks such as let's say you're on the african savannah in you'll looking to look
a new for you sort of like taking a picture visual picture of what's in front you oh they're so happens to be all lion values classification in order to determine what class of objects is in front of you this is so why in the tree house or food if it's food i wanted to get if it so why am i want to ron okay so my classification algorithm has determined by way of my stuart model that this is indeed a lion now we go to another learning algorithm what action should i take
given the circumstances you may have learned you know and shimon you may have learned that lions will you be there if thoroughly from your parents or maybe want to go by that your shoulder one day when you're on the heights so you have learned that lions will keep you in that the predicted course of action now given that there is a lion in front of you is to run away so here we have vision turning into action and if we wanted translate this into a machine learning situation we might use accomplish
no neural network in the case of classifying what you're looking at k. with vision that we might use a deep que network in order to determine what course of action or policy or plan to take given our determination sold everything in machine learning sort of boils down to this learned and predicts cycle but we have to start at the very bottom with linear logistic regression the building blocks the way goes in order to work our way out to the more advanced high level topics of things like how to take
shuns the native environment given your state or advanced algorithms in vision in classification now i wanna go on a little teach were i said that's lyric and logistic regression are like legg o's are building blocks in the grand scheme and the u. learning the latest building blocks right now nasa whites important machine learning you will find it easy theory come home was a bold branch of engineering compose a bolt if you come from the software engineering background or maybe went on
and or even mathematics you might be familiar with this thing called functional programming functional programming is style of programming and it's use languages like haskell or less where you have a function function again and it takes as its arguments other functions functions b. and c. and let's say that function be takes as its arguments d. n. the functional programming is like russian dolls where you messed up all these functions incited the child
or and eventually the very bottom you have to sort of given a number or a stirring up some constant k. and then you can like start the process conflict opening these russian dolls where time you open the russian dalton what's inside another russian on the open at what's inside another in the open that was set this is called compose ability compose ability your functions or your equations are composed all of the other functions are equations which are composed of other functions and so on so everything's nest
inside each other you already saw this in machine learning by way of logistic regression being come home is that although linear regression it is a function of linear regression to to berliner aggression on rhythm and we put it inside of logistic regression we also saw this in the steps one two and three process of machine learning we have our hypothesis function and we put that into art error function sort error function is a
function of our hypothesis function quarter function is composed of our hypothesis function and then we put our terror function we put that into the jewelry is a function that's the greatest sense that that step three training so in the case of logistic regression here's how roll on wraps we have our russian dolls are very power russian dole accused or derivative top that open inside is our los pop that open inside is our logistic function pop that open
inside this linear regression then you'll find that everything in machinery is this way now let's have a thing in mathematics it's kind of the mathematical major all of machine on her memory that machine running is kind of like up quite statistics really and calculus machine running is highly mathematical in mathematics is highly compose a ball so it's like this by nature but this is also a very useful and necessary after beauty in order to scale machine learning what's your actually dip
when these architectures you cold putting it on amazon web services at each of us and stealing them horizontally if you know anything about functional programming as a software engineer or architect you know that up proper horizontally steel ball system needs to be functional by nature and you'll find a machine running it needs to scale indeed lot of these algorithms especially once again to deep learning are faring very computational expensive very heavy algorithms in the war
virtue deployed a service that will be used by a any number of people you'd need to be able to steal horizontally in order to do that the nature of the architecture must be functional okay there was a long winded digression one of the reasons i wanted to point out this compose ability aspect of machine learning is the following you're probably shopping at the bit to learn about deep warning that's all the rage in machine learning and if he came to this pike pass because you're excited you see
ali's articles in discussions on hacker news about artificial neural networks and deep learning all the stuff that's happening in that space well patience my friends because we will get there'll be other sooner than you think will get to keep learning blacks in war to understand deep learning you have to understand logistic regression and linear regression because logistic regression is eighteen you're on a new ron in the neural network so that compose ability paradigm is that
wait here a neural network in deep learning is a function at all of logistic regression which itself is a function of love linear regression so everything's composed and nested in sight of each other so before we can get to deep learning and neural networks were really need to learn all these little basics these linear units and logistic units because they're gonna be calm neurons inside of our neural network so that faculty learning is a function of love shallow learning recall
it's shallow learning these simple algorithms like when you're logistically question okay so that was a very technical long winded episode i believe don't call me honestly believe that the next few episodes won't be nearly as technical the next episode specifically already talking about mathematics not to go into math run talk about the branches of math that you need to know nor to succeed in machine learning and how much of these types of method you need to know whether the resources that you can learn these
things center of the cassette to common question that comes up what type of nafta and you to know how much of it do i need to know can i go into machining without knowing any math etc to review episode on that sometime soon i'm into episode on languages and frame works so python versus or or versus matt lab to answer for overseas piano versus porch and then will do a high-level overview of deep learning and all these things before we finally get back into the technical details so do not fear my entire pica series will not be like this and that's lynn
regression episode which are super super technical okay where the resources for this episode no new resources on going up for you once again to the intruding coarser course so like i said in the linear regression up so that course is not optional is required you need to start on iconic keep recommending it until we start getting into new territory but the white star working on that course that's it for this episode and all see that next time


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash n. algae that and i'm also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode eight math this time we're not talk about math mathematics not that
sure clayton's the various branches of mathematics that you need to know to succeed in machine learning run away those branches are linear algebra statistics and help us now before we go into the details i don't want to scare you into thinking that you have to learn these things first in fact what i am going to recommend to you is not to learn the math first analyst in ruffle some feathers especially the mathematicians come in this pod cast in machine learning
especially we're taking these introductory courses like intruding course for these won the one text books they have in the appendix for the first or second chapter or the first or second lesson of the tangerine course up primer for all the matthew need to know is succeed for that level of machine running this introductory love old machine learning and i'm a big believer in the top down educational croce learn how to build something first of your own two hands and then you can learn the theory behind why you did what you did so for example
and whether mobile out development you can go to these boot camps were you can learn how to create a web site a high level essential to overreact or a mueller jost acacia mounsey assess the bill got your portfolio enough that you can start going to jobs in doing this today they'll start with the fundamentals teaching you prick it calculus discreet mathematics an assembly language some would say that you don't even need that staff at that high a level others would say that maybe are unique to be made that in order to truly become a match
your craft you want to learn those building blocks i might agree with the latter but i would say gopac to it later you'll be better equipped to appreciate why you're learning the fundamentals and the fundamentals will then snap into place your mind inside your machine learning our rooms where you're lacking knowledge so that's my personal recommendation about how we should approach math and machinery learn machine running first you know we're in the essentials all math for room machine learning the first jack
for the first course then either choose to learn that the mathematics fundamentals after you've learned the basics a machine learning or maybe the same time you're learning machine running some small percentage of your learning time allocated specifically to learn math say twenty percent of the learning time or one day we were the rest of the days are dedicated to learn english human okay celeste i've read into the math one f tissues where was start with linear algebra linear algebra it is the easiest of these branches of mathematics
it's also sort of the most commonly used branch in machine learning every step of your panel process uses linear algebra let's try to understand what we're outward as on what to make an analogy to cooking throughout this episode cooking some machine learning is like cooking i think linear algebra this kind of like shopping your vegetables so it's essential step at every point in your machine learning process but it's sort of an easy step you learned three quickly binge eating will give you a primer on fi
medals linear algebra and you'll be off to the race is no time was linear algebra do you remember that we didn't order the spreadsheet of rosen columns okay we call that a matrix in mathematics rose or your houses every rosenhaus an example and she knowingly nope and every column is some aspect of that house like the square foot is the number of bedrooms a number of bathrooms we call those features in machine running up and the last column is called the label is the basic actual price a
a house that we know so we can use that to compare to our own estimations and figure out how that we're going so there you have a matrix we call those taxes every row is a lower case x. the whole matrix of rosen kong's the capital tax every column of one individual role is accessible by i gained a column number two that x. three x. two x. one x. is your oath that is square footage number bedrooms number bathrooms and then will we want to do is malta
why of those values those features suspects features i fade as they get parameters it's faded that we're learning in the machine learning process we're coming up with these parameters these coefficients these waits that were multiplying through each of our rose each of the x. values in order to get one final number hypothesis age or why hacked wherever you wanna use that will be our predicted cost of the house okay so we're multiplying fate of parameters
as we have faded three fated to say one thing is your x. three x. two x. one x. your faces of the things that we're learning taxes are the actual features of the specific house so famous three times x. three faded to time sex to say one has exxon and then fade as zero which are members are biased parameter times x. zero which were always been basically make won because they zero stand alone remember an x. plus b. y. equals m. x. plus b.
bias parameters is the starting point if you don't have any data about the house you turning the production don't want any information about the square footage number badge and the senate then you just be used the average cost of houses in portland oregon s. are biased parameter are multiplying the whole list of fate as by a whole list all features are multiplying our fate of actor by our example a vector times a vector what vector back to the west they freeze its youth they want a desert bathtub after all was the
numbers are multiplying one vector by another factor now our ultimate goal is to multiply our fate of vector by the whole spreadsheet for every road in the spreadsheet we want to multiplier fate of actor into that row so the spread she's called the matrix now let's think about how we might do this and python well would have to do is a triple nested for luke for every rohner spreadsheet for every column in there
row for everything that in our favor that factor multiply and then outside that luke is to add those together and then outside that luke is to reduce them altogether a triple message for lou okay so that's fine with you do that but why this are spread she had a million rose and fifty columns last monday barry slow hands as you'll see once we get into deep learning you're gonna be multiplying major seas and vectors that
every new on and you may have a hundred or thousand your arms so using for luke's is simply not an option that's where linear algebra comes in linear algebra it is basically doing that exact same thing but with a single operation linear algebra is the study of matrix algebra it is how can you multiply a matrix your spread sheet of rosen kong's your houses by a vector of fate as all at once bambi just multiple
the process is executing this matrix algebra on your seat you or your jeep you as a final winner episode is done by way of something called a c. n. d. s. i m. t. single instruction multiple day at the allows you to multiply matrix by matrix or a matrix by a factor with one fell swoop so honestly that saves you to cons and times of time and that my friends is linear algebra is simply matrix multiplication okay let me introduce you to waugh
new word it is tense or tense or tiki and escobar that is the general word for any dimension list of things okay so we had a vector that's our fate at parameters thea three two one zero that's a factor swords a one dimensional to answer a matrix which is our spreadsheet rosen columns x-ray to x. one x. euro okay in the next road is apt to exert longer that's the two dimensional to answer
fourteen matrix you might have a cube in the case of images you have rosen columns of pixels and any individual pixel has orgy be values red green and blue values anywhere between zero and two fifty five so you have a new newest kind of death wine is like looking forward all three items so that's a three dimensional to answer campbell discord cuba i think it's called three d. tense or so testers the general word for any dimensional with the things and if that
ten sir with dimensions euro is just an number so the number one or two is easier to mention tense or unreasonably met this keep an eye out for that because you can see that in the namesake of cancer flow the most popular machine learning framework put out by google there were no discussion those languages and framework to episode so linear algebra is simply to answer math which you could do with or without linear algebra by linear algebra helps to make it fast and vector rise to any keys
it's reason about so i like to think of in my cookie malice yeah like to think of linear algebra is chopping your vegetables it's essentially you gonna do it it's easy really so we'll sit down tuesday had shot vessels again it does to a necessary step he had to take it every point in the machine learning process the next step is statistics statistics is the horde parked the very hard part the hardest mouth of the machine learning triumvirate and statistics in our cooking analogy is good
cookbook it is the recipes all the algorithms that we use in machine learning calm from statistics and flex it to six is saying hey i came up with this first linear regression that the statistics of formula logistic regression statistics those are in our protections that our hypothesis functions for hypothesis functions or statistics equations straight at us that textbook now we go to war care or functions are los functions mean squared error stats lot
likelihood function stats tsui grab our recipe book you we slide down a table we open its page one mrs rats you we insist chop some vegetables so the recipe itself is a statistics equation sure enough these equations are nothing to shake us to get me if you look at that log likelihood error function for logistic regression it was something like one over to wham times the psalm of kites am all of my times lot of our hypothesis minus one minus why times lot of one minus
our hypothesis and you add in regular is a shoe which we haven't talked about yet it's just audibly in harry if you're looking at an equation in machine learning that looks wild and crazy if statistics statistics is the heart burst the sixties what makes cooking cooking what makes a good chef a good shaft is having good recipes having a good cook book knowing how to put the right ingredients with the right other ingredients that seat essential piece of cooking if the essential piece of mud
she learned so this is why i said basically machine money could be considered a white statistics and finally we have are learning stat train or fit or learn what everyone call it step three in the machine learning process is to help us calculus calculus takes the delivery of our loss function in order to know how big of a step each faded foreigner needs to take to fix itself and it's all part of the loophole
all greedy and descent so our los function which is the statistics equation our los function could be graft in three d. space for forty space or whatever in the linear regression episode we talked about the loss function looking like a bowl in three d. but the last one she can be any number of things sometimes it looks like a mountain range when you're trying to do is traversed the space walk around in your graf until you find the smallest valley or sometimes
highest peak depending on your algorithm so it's like you're a hiker and there snow and you've got your boots you're hiding stick to snow everywhere in the visibility really before but you're trying to get to the bottom of the valley that's where that yerkes lowest as where your hypothesis function is optimal what calculus dies by taking the drug residue of your function with respect to your little guy in the functions of taking the derivatives on your mountain range the huge rid of all of somber
after with respect to your little guy in the mountain ranges like to play video games tory old he can't see well enough in front of him do to pour visibility and bitter relative creates this sort of semi trance period yellow arrow pointing down the mountain slope is really long installing a new walk always the end of this really long daryl gates that up big radiance de cents remembered this process is called read the sock were descending the mountains once again to
the end of this yellow arrow you can stop cannot take another derivative with respect to where you are now cannot make in new yellow arrow pointing you down but we're not your ego left little bit this time so great in the senate is the learning stat of our equation using to live lives that calculus in the cool thing about this is their calculus is pretty easy conceptually i mean if you understood where discredit you very good you understand intuition taking the drug rid of a function proved actual be
quite easy in machine learning at least as far as you're concerned as far as implementing these our grievances concerned lot of times when it comes to taking the derivative of all los function you can do it pretty easily by way of some trick of calculus these rules like that how or rule or the chain will be just memorize these sort of sparks notes calculus shirts off with the rest in order to get rid of all lost function so you transform your loss function into a new function that's good too
riveted and that tells you how much of a step to take in which direction now all of this fits into our cooking analogy very effectively actually it's like putting the trade into the oven setting the heated for sixty five and pressing start okay if the final step it's like putting your fate of parameters all you say parameters in your hypothesis function in the initial steps that one project they're all set to zero were sometimes are all set to some random small number
really i've said initially take a random shot a dark so that the learning phase can tell you how bad you were step by step by step through great said until all your fate of parameters are just right so this that is like cooking your fate of parameters the all star our raju k. your hypothesis function yet it's roxy put in the oven and now they all start to cook and smell delicious and brown and finally your daytime or beings and it's ready to come out the other than all your thinner parameters are just right in
she in learning we have this final step of learned by way of calculus and that is the name's sake of machine learning learn machine learn so away this bill lynch pin of our machine learning puzzle was says what differentiates machine learning from other fields like statistics in our cooking analogy we compare this step to cooking cooking a dish is done namesake for the field of cookie if your cook them is a lot of stuff that goes and cheer
crafts your chopping vegetables you're putting together arrested the than the final step is putting a tray in the oven hitting start in that final step is actually cooking the dish so that's that is the namesake for cooking the field of cooking just like the learned step of calculus by way of gray in the sand machine learning is the namesake of machine learning and by the way we've been talking about calculus as a means for descending the error graf by way of agreed to send this apple cage
of calculus towards minimizing some function is a branch of mathematics called optimization borges convex optimization convex means that the graph sort of looks like a cop for twenty to the bottom of that caught convex is caught in the shape of a graph we're trying to traverse the graph by way of calculus to the bottom of the cop this is a spinoff of calculus called convex optimization in the same way that physics is a spinoff of calculus optimization is
captain so you may see when you ask somebody what nafta or need to learn for machinery know say when around raw statistics calculus and optimization what kind of optimization toward goes hand in hand with calculus stuff and you'll learn them together the specific application of calculus you're learning in the case of machine earnings called optimization is not something you need to go off somewhere and independently in the beginning this is something to be aware of peacekeeping aisle for that worked for wanna go over one more time sort of what each branch of mathematics is
for independent the machine learning so linear algebra is all about matrix math for cancer math to use that in machine learning at every step where your combining faces and exits or any other sort of ten sir matthew might be doing a machine which is very frequent statistics is the mouth of the populations of things were looking in the portland housing market we have a whole bunch of deity in our hands we wanna come up with some sort of probability
strube you shouldn't of the portland housing market okay it's such an sob branch of statistics call probability you can be learning two branches of stat probability and then inference inference is the step of making a prediction about a new house has it fits into the market so statistics is all about the death and then calculus the field of calculus is all about motion of objects invisible world sort of physics calms directly from calculus and fizz
dixie might put no video game dole out objects dropping inbound saying in your running into walls and you're walking up and down mountains of like that's a basket of how in machine running full earnings that is our little dot descending victor are slow to the bottom of the valley if the motion of an object in the physical world that physical world is a graphic thereby statistics this the distribution of our day that we're least the distribution of our errors given the faded
renders using a hypothesis function so we're out for breast cancer math stats is degas probabilities that says distributions of day that inference stats is making predictions on dana and calculus is motion in the physical world namely motion of our little paradox to the bottom of the valley now whitehead said in the beginning of the episode jolt learn math first learn math to rue machine learning learn the essential math
the need for machine learning for room machine learning it's like learning the essentials of cooking in general by cooking some dishes you don't go off and take a course on cooking and then start making some dishes you the other way around you start cooking dishes and you learn the principles of cooking through the act of cocaine now let's say you end up at some steak house and everything sir great cook them all in to some money but you wanna steal ladder you wanna be the best shot
if there ever was you were working some fancy rash or maybe open your own in paris will now we're gonna go back and you're going to find some books on how to chop vegetables perfect how often does everything needed be for certain dishes why do certain ingredients pair affectively with the fury of ingredient matching without temperature with the optimal temperature for specific ingredients and how do we find that to be the case and why is that the case the similarly with machine learning you can go back now can you
start taking out the details of linear algebra start learning old from some of these more esoteric concepts like like i gain of actors and coefficient major sees i understand why the statisticians chose these hypothesis and lost functions for specific models how did they come to these equations so when you learn math after you learn math through machine learning you got an eye for these things if you were to learn math first your eyes would glaze over because you were
have an appreciation of where these equations are being applied so you don't know what you're looking at him when i see so calm as a result of that is that people burning out on math before they get back to machine morning and then they go with their legs tucked between their tails six plus we're back to their prior feel like wet development to learn math after the start to pay attention to the details of the equations and it's sort of like gandalf nice poring over all those books he's looking for something and he catches something that people didn't catch that
for okay so enough of my opinions on now going to be resources for learning math year after machine learning or some small percentage while you're learning machine earning more hey if you wanna just ignore me in just learned for machine running references resources section and break it down into a few categories one is milks by way of a company called chronic academy you never milks like you gatsby corsair out all those things online courses videos and lessons quizzes all that stuff connick yeah
i mean is sort of high school level or katie lowell courses white u. s. history includes calculus one two and three statistics in linear algebra c. can learn all of your math basics from con academy will close links to that show that's the next category is textbooks so if you prefer to learn by text books instead of milks all posts what i've seen to be commonly recommended from course curricula or from recommendations encores
overflow cetera textbooks for statistically around who brought and calculus all also post t. f.'s for primers on the basics of these mathematics branches that you need to succeed in machine learning so maybe three or four page key yes they're primers on just the essentials maybe in countless just taking derivatives of functions in statistics it would be some basic probability theory and inference so those are three
categories different roaches we take to math and on any give you one final category and this is a little bit hard core but i really personally like this it's the course series on line called the great courses we used to be called the teaching company they put out these thirty video series on every topic on us on history cooking arts and they do indeed have math calculus one two and three and statistics to series on statistics
i don't think they have anything on linear algebra but if they do all posted there is one course i wanna drop particular attention to what's called a mathematical decision making is actually very similar to this part cassie reason honestly much more professional league on babylon mine it covers all of the machine learning topics with a special focus on the mathematics is actually a study of the field called operations research which is very similar to machine learning more official told since it's like math for managers trying to decide scheduling
employees or train departure times or factory settings it turns out the math is there some work for your new learning and achievements of course is a mathematical decision making on post and show notes now here's the catch with the series there are video series but i wouldn't necessarily recommend them as a primary source of education for these topics go tom academy or go to one of those textbooks instead but what i use the series forties i convert them to audio and i'll listen to it on my ipod one our next
sizing or cooking or cleaning commuting et cetera so obviously you appreciate audio supplementary education because you're listening to the spot fast so that's how i used the series as audio supplementary education video converted to audio now that sounds really harcourt because obviously we're talking matthew these professors in the referencing graphs and charts and equations burden of the points of things in asking you to look at things as they explain them the one nice thing about these course series is that the instructor
are fairly good at near reading their passions for bully talking you threw everything they're doing status of okay i'm drawing all wine horizontally this is x. axis i'm trying every kwanzaa why axes and making us quickly line now goes up then it goes down the niggers up and as a dot on the valley and so they're very good about near reading the whole process is definitely bit of the brain exercise your gilmore the well caffeinated if you read you what i do and convert these video series to audio use put them on your guy pa
i as video and simply listen to the audio or actually have a script that iran bash scripts that converts videos to compete three files all post and the shone out spike can recommend agree course is enough not even just for mass on june the calculus one two three courses the statistics and this is the sixth to have the whole thing about philosophy of mind whether ai ek she's consciousness the father of our minds as machines to have a whole series on neuroscience so lots of supplementary so
off fringe lee related to machine learning by the way degree courses can be quite expensive maybe a hundred dollars per course if something has an audio format option like the philosophy of mine one dies you can get it from kabul by way of amazon for cheaper but the math ones i'm going to reference in the show notes or video only so you have to buy them as video unencumbered and audio okay so that's it for this episode on math the next episode will be about people earning of the

this is the episode that you've all been waiting for even if you didn't know you've been waiting for it deep learning and artificial neural networks this is the very exciting stuff that's happening in the world of machine learning in twenty seventeen when you see on hacker news or just the actual news artificial intelligence and machine learning being applied to new and innovative spaces is almost always keep learning they're talking about neural networks if you have any sort of bakker
and interest in machine learning prior to him barking on this pod cast been you've already had your ears perked to deep learning and may be wondering what neural networks are all about if this pod cast is maybe your first introduction to machine learning well then just keep your ears perked because this is the stuff this the most interesting in the space right now no i keep saying keep learning and neural networks their slightly different first off remember everything in machine learning as hierarchical we start with ai
that's broken down into machine learning and some other sub fields machine is broken down is supervise on supervise and reinforcement learning supervised is broken down into various categories one of which is called deep learning the other which is shallow learning shallow learning is the stuff that we've been learning so far linear regression would just aggression a handful of other our rhythms that we will be talking about in subsequent episodes were to skip over them now and jump right in the deep learning the reason i'm doing that because i wanna whet your appetite
i also want to appease the bitch don't know what you have to work very curious about the blurring the fire ago the standard education or route you would take me many many many episodes until we landed on deep learning so i just wanna give you a hint of what it is now so you can at least understand what news articles are talking about before we dive back into the details of showing our rhythms so we have to keep learning in shallow learning and then keep learning is broken down into various other space is one which is called neural net
works artificial neural networks for eight and anne's as far as you're concerned deep learning it he is neural networks the other models with indeed learning i haven't really seen them in the wild whether it's professional your academically really essential deep learning can be boiled down as neural networks and the neural networks themselves are broken down into different types of neural network models which will talk about him a bit for example most allaire perception ons work for neural networks combo whoosh
no no my works etc to this episode is all about the subspace of supervise learning called deep learning emirate talk about what it's branches called neural networks the only branches for your concerns and some of it's some branches wire neural networks so interesting and exciting on a good three reasons why make is that they may or may not school get to this later represents the human brain which of course takes us a lot closer artificial intelligence
that's our goal there little bit magical way they work internally is like a black box we don't know what's going on in the little brain of these neural networks unlike the shallow learning our britain's war we know jacquie what's happening in deep learning that a lot of it's learning be inside the box and we can peek inside it's very magical another reason is that it is fast said sue mean the other spaces of artificial intelligence remember how i said in the past we have a natural language processing and vision and all
these other subspace is which have been consumed by machine running now vision is almost entirely the domain of convolution ono met works language modeling is almost the entire domain above work for neural network caesar all deep learning machine learning algorithms so is specifically by way of deep warning within the machine in world that machine learning has calmed to sub sue me other spaces of artificial untold gents and in that way it's almost like deep warning is the master all
rhythm of intelligence service lot of magic behind deep learning a lot of automation as well as diminutive spaces of artificial intelligence is speaking of black box the third reason all give that makes deep learning special is that it removes machine learning one step all way from the programmer remember that i said that the closer it your program is to the program or bullets it feels like artificial intelligence artificial intelligence remember is simply defined
as automating any mental task if you could build a perfect role based system like the symbol lists were trying to do in the early days of our official told us that would still be artificial intelligence budget if else roles that doesn't feel very much like our official told us and furthermore it feels like impossible task how could you possibly enumerate all the if the old rules of the universe so we came up with statistical approaches to machine learning like we've seen with when you're in logistic regression
we have the state of brammer so we've learned we boil down aspects of the universe into the east say the parameters and then we can use them to make estimations so that's one step removed the machine learns these parameters on its own well deep learning does that even the extra step which were now discussing a bit it's called feature learning it has to do with the features that we've been looking at a linear regression for example you might have x. three x. two x. one x. zero square
good to the house member bedrooms number of bathrooms and this is to downtown the thrall of features will if the model is impossible to represent linear lee as is the case in many things in the real world than that x. three x. two x. one x. zero breakdown does not work you can represent your date as all wynona graf maybe it's a squid or mcgrath so you have to learn how to combine features in the specific way maybe squaring the square footage or combining the square footage with the distance the downtown
in some way to create a new graf knowing how to do that how to combine specific features is a programmers task in shallow learning but indeed learning the neural network learns how to combine parameters away that is effective so it's another layer removed from the programmer which makes it a little bit more magical little bit closer to the angle of artificial intelligence okay let's take a little step back and differentiate shallow learning from to
learning shallow learning is everything that we've been learning so far linear and logistic regression i don't really have a concrete way to represent shallow learning i think of it as the pistol of machine learning really small algorithms or mathematical equations you had been at it and put it does a quickie inside a box and out comes in output by comparison to deep learning which i think of like a bazooka you pipe in an input to a factory castle now comes in output let's use that castle analogy what makes deep learning deep
is that your stacking shallow learning algorithms deeply okay so we already been talking about when you're logistical aggression logistic regression is a ole go a single way go in the late though castle that is a deep neural network sewing neural network is composed of little way goes and those lay goes can be shallow learning our rhythms specifically in a mall tyler percent drawn the vanilla form of a artificial no met worker to talk about a bit you have
religious sticker gresham unit logistic regression lego is the primary piece of your nomad work so take logistic are rational we've are you one for prayer episode combine a bunch of those together whether and now you have a neural network so shallow learning is your basic algorithms indeed learning is taking those things and combining them deeply into a network an artificial neural network why we call it a neural network is because the units of this network that were constructing a
a little way goes the units themselves are called neurons us talk a little bit about the history of this unit we learned as logistic regression to classify or thing for classifying dana is his house expensive or isn't it is this a picture of a dog or isn't it it actually is a little bit deeper than that there's a history involving characters by the name of war in mcculloch and walter cuts proposed the mathematical rep
resent haitian upon the human biological mural on these were both computer people but mccollough closing euro physiologist and hits with the computational neuroscientist to these guys are no new bees to the space of the actual human brain was frank rosenblatt the ritual we came up with the idea of a perception on the news these two guys is sort of formalized it as an artificial mule on a perception on is a step was function it's similar to adjust
progression that little bit different were ignore that fact for now think of the perception and as logistic work russian wrap your logistic regression into a unit will call it the unit and now you have what we call an artificial neural on according to mcculloch and pits the mathematical representation of the human neural on this very interesting so i think a lot of misconception about neural network says that they were inspired by the brain in a very fuzzy way by computer scientists who don't know one thing rather
about the brain absolutely not was inspired by the brain in a very real way that each of these units is believed to be the mathematical representation awful biological knew ron selected that from the top one more time we have mcculloch and cuts in europe physiologist it computational neuroscientist cool looking into the human brain and formalizing what they believe to be a mathematical representation of the biological knew ron they call the senate or official knew ron which
string of bunch of these together and we have what's called a neural network as far as we're concerned for this episode eighteen year on it he is logistic regression to wrap up your logistic regression into a unit the string almost together and you have a neural network lane you're on doesn't have to be logistic regression in the case with frank rosenblatt he used something called in hirsh said tron which is a step was function very similar swords can continue calling it would just aggression in logistic or signal with
on june unit and the first artificial mule network to come to be is called a mole tie layer perception on so it's a lot of verbiage hear lots of words so let's start the hot again we have people earning the field of connecting shallow learning algorithms together in a deep ways stacking them with deportees broken down into neural networks artificial neural networks and an artificial neural networks are broken down into various types of artificial mailman works why
scold accomplish all neural network and others call the records neural network these are used for various different spins off of deep learning applications such as language modeling image recognition et cetera but the vanilla neural network sort of the poster child of neural networks business thing that we call it a malt high layer percent tron word feed ford network him altay layer perception or the earliest versions of a neural network created before they started specializing neural networks in various ways for different applications so
that's already be sought him out in this episode in malta jai alai your percent tron what does the neural network look like let me try to paint a picture in your head and then we're gonna talk about an example of why you're using your own at work the way you might invasion that the neural network is coming from the left i'm going to the right on the left you have your input that comes in so for example or spreadsheet every roll one roa time calms again from the left we
take our role and reflected on its side so it's so looks like a column feature feature feature feature features all the features of stacked square footage number bedrooms number bathrooms etc so as the first layer it's called the input layer imagine he's a little circles so each of our taxes as a circle all of those then feed it to the right into new circles each pinpoint feature each input feature feeds into
a layer of neurons let's say that there's five neons five foot logistic regression units each feature feeds into each meal on in this new layer sir we're going from left to right to hear it puts in feeding them into each of the neurons and then let's go right one more layer and we have our output function our objective functional hypothesis function is our final logistic regression unit is
wintertime less whether or not a house is expensive for example in the case of a classification neural network so the architecture goes from left to right imagine a column of circles over your gun puts one row of your day down with each circle is one feature of that row they all feed into a new layer of circles those are your neurons the corner activation functions or activation units they're all just logistic regression
and they all piped into your fine old single new on the third layer and that's your final class of fire your objective or hypothesis function so we have an input layer on the far left that's your data it hikes into a hidden layer it's called will see why it's called in layered abed those are your neurons your activation functions and those pipe into a third layer called your output layer so bad
the architecture of the neural network as sounds all well that why old and hard to understand what's use an example to help you understand this would icons to health care they are many features about an individual which might determine that the medical costs of all that individual would say that an insurance agency is interested in how much to charge the person based on various aspects about their life things like gauge whether they're a smoker
whether there are obese etc well your first impression is to use linear regression those are all features the high command linear regression an outcome hawaii which is the cost per individual of medical bills but that doesn't work that way it turns out with health these features don't apply in the linear fashion it turns out that age gets more and more and more important the older you get the snow
linear it's all a bit more like texts squared so it's more likely the case that you're sixteen years old you had the doctor maybe once a year or four years older than the doctor maybe once every six months ago when she started in the nineties you seeing the doctor may be weekly sottile little bit more like a pauline o'neill function x. squared so we already cannot use linear regression here but there may be other combinations of features in our example for day
all we know with the smoking and obesity combine to be greater than the sum of its parts it turns out that an obese person and a smoker separately have their own health issues but if all those are combined it causes even worse issues than those separately to combine nonlinear lee now if we knew little bit about this already as i'm explain to you right now all we do know we could construct a holy know me old linear
aggression algorithm out of combinations of features like each square obesity times smoking etc manually but again we do things mentally that's not very machine learning is it and most the time we don't know enough about the puzzle to construct combinations of features like that ourselves as we won the machine money now grown to be able to do figure out how features combined in a specific way most effectively to deal to determine the output
so let's see how a neural network might handle this situation let's use that malts high layer perceptual and architecture that i just described will start from the left wheel and put one role at a time for mark sri nina is set grammar from the portland housing market we import a spread sheet of training at the data for which we already know the answer what's the cost of the house so every rohner spreadsheet is a house may recall on it is that it's the
cheers on that house such a square footage number bedrooms number bathrooms in the final column is the label or the gnome cost for the house on a case of logistic regression were we were just trying classify whether a house was expensive or not dennis is gonna be a zero whirl wind yes or no in the case of regression are labels will be numbers and a case of classification or labels will be a yes or no so far neural network we're going to the same thing remote upload spreadsheet it's gonna have rows of people in the columns of features on those
bull such as age b. m. i. a. whether or not they smoke and various other things like location do they exercise do they have a healthy diet et cetera and the final call on is in the case of regression maybe the yearly medical costs of the individual or fu wanted you classification maybe will say is this an expensive person ought not we're gonna do a regression example miss case sore neural network will take one roll roll by row had been as the first way or that is
first layer of our neural network each circle of that layer in a column is a feature of the first row and each of those features heights to each of the neurons on the second layer we called each of these neurons a unit word activation function in our case of the mole tyler percent on we're using logistic regression as the activation function so part activation function is to say to more aid or blood
you stick function was pretend we have five neurons in that second layer they each feature of the first row of data will be fed into each new lawn of that layer remember this layers called the thin layer so each input feeds into each of the neurons of the hidden layer and in each of those neurons feeds into the last meal on which is the objective or hypothesis function neurons of the hidden layers the layers
between the input layer and out where are called activation functions and activation function depends on what function you used in the near on which shall learning arbor than you used in our case it's logistic regression for using the sycamore it function or logistic function so the activation functions of our hidden layer is the sycamore eight or logistics function at all the logistic regression and those all feed into the final muir on which is our hypothesis
or objective function white is going on in that he then later here is what's going on every feature of our role the feeding into the neural network is being combined with every new ron of the hidden layer with a hidden layer is doing is learning how to combine the features optimal e. and then it sends all those alps to the final
all neuron full tell you the final result function in our case may be linear regression if we wanna estimate the projected cost of the individual deity or what may be logistic regression is to try and classify something the point is that the purpose of that hidden layer is to try it every which way a combination of features from our data in order to learn the best way to combine features so let's say that my figure out that age can
mine is best with itself in other words page squared like we said before or it might figure wrote that smoking and wait combined to the purpose of that hidden layer is to find a optimal combinations of features in order that the neural network can properly protected values and by the way i apologize if your reign in the background i have to do this episode outside unfortunately so long story c. may hear some background nature noises so remember the freeze
that's the machine learning far project case a remake of butter production football for rose or spreadsheet figaro how bad we did that's the loss function and then shot rain schrade up on that lost function in its this training step or the learns that this final step we're using an algorithm called back propagation it's the staff to application of gradient descent sosa way we would make greeted descents deep
talk about that a bit is his final training step that has each of the notes of the hidden layer warren how often morey to combine features okay and so there you see a single layer or neural network learning how to best combined parameters for a situation which is nonlinear and of course our final i'll put some sure objective function in this case is linear regression because we want a number and a case across the k.
shoot is logistic regression okay now we learned one super power above neural networks feature learning learning how to combine features no way to construct on nonlinear function but neural networks have another secret power hierarchical representation of the breaking your david down hair prickly by way of this feature learning paradigm deeply stacked deep
we don't care so let's switch to a new example removal away from this whole situation and to face recognition in the images so we're to do is worry about load a bunch of images of faces and non face it's so skinny a classification example non faces might be a picture of a dog or a picture of a house no real quick i'm not to get too deep into this but we've been applauding spreadsheets of rosen columns rose or or individual examples and homes or their feet
ers the way we would turn an image into a spreadsheet like that is we would take its pixels pretend that it's a five by five image flatten it so it's now the twenty five by one roll call vote call arms where each column work each feature is a pixel and then we'll take those pixels which are currently or g. b. values in color and transform it into gray scale so that each pixel could be represented as a single number
and we take all our images and they're now rose and we put them in for spreadsheets a very very distant a bunch of pictures and you turn him into a spreadsheet bill sealed immoral that we get the details like andrew being coarser course of course our final call on that is whether or not the thing it is a picture of a face so your ego we hiked are spreadsheet into or neural network or neural network takes it one road time we're going to train on each row
first we're going to do the feed for the past feet forward that's the prediction step of our one two three machine learning step was a process feet forward pass will give us a prediction as to whether or not is a picture of the face then we will use or loss function to figure out how bad the neural network dead and then we will send them back through the network in a backwards pass called back propagation which will use gradient
santa at each year on to update the weights of fate as in each new ron so that the whole neural network will get more accurate by the end of the spreadsheet after it has seen all the examples but here's the twist to this neural network or have to hit in layers so there's four layers now to hold all the first layers called the book where it is simply all the features of an individual row and that will happen once
for every role of our spreadsheets of the neural networks input layer has the size of twenty five twenty five pixels free five by five pixel image and its neural network will be used over and over and over for each row of the spreadsheet the next layer is our first hidden layer so or pixels of an individual row from the in the lair connects to each new ron of the first hidden layer so what is that he and layer
trying to do now we said that the purpose of that the lady are in the neural network is to combine that all the features of the input no way that the whole is different than the sum of its parts so what are the things we're combining here well or combining all the pixels of the damage work shrine or hand act of one should love combinations of pixels in order to give us something new so that first layer might be combining
all the pixels to figure out if there's lines or edges or concourse in the image they will combine all those pixels into winds and those lines are now all new features those are now the features all the first hit in the layer those features get cents to the second hidden layer which tries a bunch of combinations of those features in order to figure out
to combinations are important so the second layer might be combining lines and edges and contour is into eyes and ears and mouth and nose and then it will take all those combine them into one of which is our final output the opal way or the object of function the hypothesis function a logistic regression unit that holds us whether or not we're looking at a face so he'd neural network does two things one
it breaks thing down into chunks and to it combines things at that level in or to find important combinations to make a determination so for our image the first layer is the input layer the second layer is the first hidden layer of neurons teaching your honor is called an activation function in our case the activation function is the signal we do or logistic function from logistic regression in
other words he's your honor is logistic regression and all the neurons of the first hidden away or are trying to combine all the pixels of the image in every which way possible in order to find important combinations of pixels well in the learning process of backup propagation the final step we're going to be training these neurons we're going to be telling these yawns whether or not some combination of pixels
it found was important or was not this the training set up so this first hidden layer is finding combinations of pixels that makes important things those things in our case are likely to be lions edges and cons wars well it's not up to boston euro met work itself will figure out you'll figure out what combinations of pixels combine in a certain way that it finds important in order to increase its production accuracy now what that first hit in layer is now
acting as the input layer into the second hidden layer all the neurons of the first and layer all accommodations of features from the picture are now in new features and those features go into the second hidden layer it is the purpose of the second had nowhere to combine those new features into again new features to the things that the second handle arab might learn our eyes and ears and other things objects of
a face that it will combine all those together into the wall asked knew ron at the objective function of the logistic regression hypothesis function which will tell us the gate or name is this a face so bye think that's really cool we have logistically gresham which we learn a prior episode for classification of a very simple pattern well off base in a picture is not a simple pattern it is not a linear function you can't possibly the goal line on some
scatter plot of pictures of faces this method does in make sense that the united with visualize and your brain doesn't make sense what you can do is look at face and come up and parts cut out the eyes of the face cut out the no's couple mouth then cut those up into further parts until we have winds work backwards from there really is what we're doing a neural networks in order to combine things into higher he were the final loops of the higher key is a yay or nay so by like to
you give it like him or charge of a company let's say that we have the box the head honcho the company that ceo he is the object of function these are hypothesis function our last muir on or i'll put a layer under him he has supervisors they are the second henley are the supervisors each have subordinates employees who work honor them now on like a typical organisation shark which is purely hierarchical
where supervisor has their own employees each of our supervisors is sharing the employees of the company so's not purely hierarchical so what happens well this organization that ball resides inside the building that building is called a neural network we don't personally know what's going on inside the company manages itself will we knock on the door in the door opens and we hands an employee a picture an employee caps on his nose give you up and says okay off come right
after all tell you whether or not is a face egos aside and all the employees huddle together around the picture and are all pointing at various pixels and some other employees point as other pixel this one's blackmail yeah but this one's white leather all try to combine all the pixels of the picture in their minds is ten employees huddled around the picture and i've got magnifying glasses out well ten employees means tenure on its meaning of some sort of combinations of pixels it to be boiled down into ten principal components maybe
a dark think line and i short skinny line and stuff like this okay they all nod their head may think they have their solutions they walk down the hall to the room with their supervisors and each one of them reports to each of the supervisors each supervisor is looking for specific object we've got left by a supervisor right by a supervisor knows supervisor mouth supervisor last year and write your eyes ears mouth nose so let's six supervise
years six neurons in the second in later mean it is six specific objects that were trying to be attacked at this layer of the hierarchy soul left eye supervisors listening to the report from all of his subordinates all ten employees were all clamoring over themselves basis hush hush hush spoke everybody raise your hand if you saw the line or an edge and all raise their hands and sorry got the senses yes okay we definitely have left by so they all run over
the nose supervisor and he says okay everybody who has a thick vertical edge raise your hands and three razor hani's okay now i need us circle ish wine anybody in one raises their hand he says okay how about how bout a shadow kind of figure and no we raise their hands these kind of nodding themselves i'm knees as clipboard miss penny he's checked off seven out of the ten features he's looking for his kind scratching his chin is what you gonna call it it's uno was missing three of the features but it's in
ups seven's enough for me waited some remember that logistic regression works on awaited some such that if we get a seventy percent of one hundred percent and say yes if anything under fifty percent it's an know all the hidden layer to supervisor in your audience now have all their cancers whether or not they have the object they're looking for eyes ears mouth and that's the mail or rushed down the hall with their quick boards to the boxes room the ceo is at the top floor with these windows overlooking the city he turned around
in his chair is a big fat man he's got a cigar is now off the fancy suit because while boys do with the eyes ears now the nose and bull's eyes supervisors raise their hand yes we both saw eyes nose supervisor raises his hand i saw knows what mouth doesn't raise his hand soap boxes scratching his chin is looking at this club or shifting his cigar from left to right of his mouth and some maybe there's a beer or maybe something was obstructing the mouth who knows ancona face yes we now face seventy percent probability that we're lookin' interface silly
comes down the stairs and he opens the door were waiting patiently outside the company's building praises tyler on an essay to face seventy percent probability i'll give him with a sad look on my face 'cause i knew from the spreadsheet i a job to him i gave him a picture we're already knew the answer is not a face it's a dodd the answer is zero and he gave me point seven so i use my walks function remember it's called cross entropy in the case of neural network simple little bit diff
i've been a typical logistic regression cross and chirpy los function but is fundamentally the same in you'll learn the details may intervene course so i use my little function i calculate how off he was and i tell them i say you were off by this amount and he slices forehead and he is mad so he went back to his supervisors and says guys you are easily yelling at them and they're all shifting on comparable in looking down at the ground and in his mind he's changing some numbers something a parameters remember each new law
including the hypothesis function has a set of fate of parameters just like in logistic regression so he's a digesting all the fate of parameters in his head as he's barking worse to his supervisors now each of the supervisors adjust their fate of parameters in their own heads as their rundown all up to their midway from the start yelling at their planes and each of the employees starts adjusting fate of parameters in their heads as they're looking miserable in the ground and taking no lashing and they turn
around a look at the picture and they open their mouth steel of the picture but but the picture doesn't have faded parameters the picture can't fix itself the pictures the picture so of course the input layer doesn't change and that last learning step of yelling down the tree is called back propagation it is running greedy and descents down the war chart of the neural network so there you have it the neural network or keep learning what it does is it's just like any other supervise learning
system except that it learns how to combine features in important ways and if necessary hierarchical e. how to break down your day get into a hierarchy of features and i hark ye of combinations on features so when we say deep we mean the number of layers the number of hierarchical layers in the break down and we say why did we mean that the number of neurons in each layer
a white layer has a lot of neurons a deep network has a lot of layers neural networks are sort of a silver bullets they can handle any lean your situation just like a linear algorithm good can't handle stuff that's nonlinear which linear algorithms cannot they can handle housing market estimations linear where they can handle face productions in images nonlinear so there is silver bullet by what
you take that statement with a grain of salt because you should not treat them like a silver bullets can you use neural networks did everything yes should you use neural networks in everything mel wall i why shouldn't you use no met works for everything well it turns out that many problems or linear and many problems don't need to combine features baby is not some wine autograph like when you're aggression but you could use an algorithm like
the scene again for its which doesn't depend on the combination of its features nor to succeed there are many other shallow algorithms order to be going over in future pod cast episodes be seen in france decision trees support vector machines k. nearest neighbor k. means algorithms all these things are shallow there quick and they can handle and many real world problems will if people earning can handle most if not all real world problems and shallow learning can handle
some real world problems why shouldn't i use deep learning for everything the reason is that people earning is expensive very very expensive on your computer to run a typical shallow learning our rhythm like linear regression or the scene in france you could probably do it on the laptop for people earning you're going to want to rent space on a job you what's cluster of titan x. g. p. you machines i mean the difference in performances scale ability of deep learning versa
shallow learning is significant and can cost you an arm adelaide if you're running an online service i like to compare it to our board chart analogy if your situation is linear the result would happen you would knock on the door of the company a new hand or role of your data to the employees they will take that role in all look at a scratch their heads may determine that there is no sort of combination of features that needs to happen so they all look each other and they shake their head may pass it on that we're just gets passed on as
is to the second and lay or your supervisors they'll do the same thing this crash ahead a look at the data and determine that there's no sort of combinations of features as necessary nor hierarchical breakdown of that data bill look at each other they shake their head and a past that day on to the boss and this time the bosses and some fat cigar smoker he does all the work he's linear regression at the end of your chain and he starts cameron chiseling that this thing and outcomes of solution so you just
they eat a whole company of employees to do the work of one percent linear regression that's why you don't want to use deep learning for everything because you don't have to and it costs more money and time to compute the deep learning solution than a shallow learning solution so it's still is in your interests to learn these various shall learning algorithms and where they apply the ruddy going over various our present and future episodes okay so that was a mural
i'll work my friends it's called a malt high earlier perception on a feed forward most highly your perception on and a perception on because the type of neuron we're dealing with is in most examples that you'll see a what's called a perception or step wise function but in our case we use logistic regression is basically the same so it still counts mole tyler because we have one or two hidden layers and feed forward you see this word feet forward as the feet forward pass that you do in the initial productions
at the window safety for now work like a thief forward a mall failure perception but they're referring to is bayou comparison to other types of architecture for example a thing called a word current neural network it doesn't exactly feed it gets degas forward if he didn't like that into itself we're gonna go over with colonel networks in future episode most neural network architectures or feet forward but there are some sheffield twists of an architecture that can do occur
persian and other types of feeding one final technical side that is that in the back propagation step of neural networks you may or may not be using gradient descent it's height of things that is used for training is called an optimize or so great in dissent that we've been talking about all these episodes for the learning step of machine learning is in a optimize are in their various other types of optimize years that you can use
called the grad one called adam but i just wanted to be aware that if you just jump into the deep than any star working with your own iwerks you start seeing these optimize or is used the hell we're names like that at a grad adam what they're doing there is they're replacing gradient descend with maybe some more specialized or optimize optimize or for that particular architecture okay i wanna compare keep learning to the brain we did this little then the beginning of the abyss of an hour and come back to it being you're on
in a human brain looks like this we've got a cell body lope along any into it comic inputs by way of the structure called ben fright so has the full lines coming into it and i'll concede output of an you're on that alkaline books i tailed it's called an x. on so physically a human you're on looks a little bit like an artificial miron an artificial miron takes inputs from all of the dado or the way you're before that it does some competition the mill
that's collect the sole body or the soma of the new ron and out of it comes the output there's a lot of debate as to whether the artificial muir on created by mcculloch in it's really does represent a biological human you're on i think the argument might be missing the point from a functional us perspective they do the same thing is a common point of comparison you'll see made between birds and planes in order to achieve flight in or kira we didn't have to create jai
in flopping feathered wings instead we use the laws of thurman dynamics to create a giant metal box with stationary wings the point is to achieve the same effect will are official neurons may or may not represent the human your honor enough on away and but functionally they achieve the same effect and in our way i think is safe to say that neural networks are our big chance towards solving intelligence and bring up the brain again for another reason in the human for
name we have different centers dedicates court solving different tasks speech image recognition planning etc each of those centers of the brain is what's called a nucleus it's not like to sell body in biology it's the same word in neuroscience they call the center of the brain annals of specific task a nucleus and a nucleus is nothing more than as far as we're concerned the neural network so a neural network in order for
told no my work land of machine learning is like a nucleus of the brain now as differ nuclei of the human brain are taylor towards handling different tasks they have slightly different physical architectures let's say that primary visual within the human brain has maybe shorter asks aunts or some different combinations of neurons in a specific way that makes it very good at handling vision where broke is area for speech might be physically structured in a different way
human brain doesn't use the exact same nucleus architecture all throat the brain instead it's specializes in various nuclei to be better at particular tasks is still uses the master algorithm of the new ron and combinations of the new on but it does so with a twist deferred for plants we're still dealing with blueprints within a house but just different floor plans for different specialization it's you'll find this to be the case in our fish
neural networks as well within deep learning you'll rarely see the most highly air perceptual used in the wild the most highly air perception on is sort of the trainers and neural network neural network one oh one thing that i taught you in this episode is like neural network wanna want this not really what you're gonna be using most of the time in vision for example recognizing images what we did actually in this episode the most common neural network you'll see here is co
the convolution old neural network and has additional types of layers inserted in the neural network different types of neurons so you may not be using logistic regression units for example for language modeling or anything in the domain of natural language processing your money you something called the work current neural network and bark n. n. and s. has a special tweak of the architecture like i mentioned earlier that neurons can feed back into themselves its pre clever and for planning
all you something called a deep que network henri de que en su variations of the general neural network architecture with a twist to make architectures specifically suitable for specific applications now like i said each of these different architectures might use a different type of new on or activation function or hypothesis function remember in your on inside the thin layers the neurons in the black box or called activation functions
and the final meal on or final neurons of the output layer is called the hypothesis function or objective function activation functions and in layers hypothesis function it be in the alcove where you may use logistic regression or soft max were linear regression in the final i'll put you on or any number of things in the heat in layers you're more likely to see a thing called raya lu or he held you rectified linear unit
as for the more common types of activation functions were more common neurons in neural now works another type you might see is to hand at each and there are quite similar to signori functions they get pretty much look the same to all of them look like an ass to say to defer way in a case of rae lewis flack for x. equals zero all as stuff isn't so important it's it's easy understand the neural network as stacked sig moret functions since you've already learned this ignored function but you may be dealing with different types of activation functions different types of neurons and you
lead to determine earl why you would use a different your honor murders different circumstances is based on the way the math works out for that particular architecture that particular neural network you're using it may learn better using calculus you need backup propagation stab degree in the sense that the calculus may work better for certain neurons under certain architectures me personally i just take whatever your honor we're architecture is popular in the space and i just rolls
marineau in question and so that's it my friends as steep learning math neural networks like i said we're going to come back to shallow learning algorithms like support back to machines decision trees k. nearest neighbors came means the scene in france et cetera and eventually will get back into deep learning and talk about record neural networks convolution all male met works de que networks and all those things for the resources of this episode i'm going to recommend a mini series on you
to which will give you a label lands of people earning architectures really short videos providing the visuals representing various people earning models like r. n. n.'s c. n. n.'s etc you can plow through that one pretty fast then as usual i want you finished and trooping corsair course he has a whole week or two dedicated to neural networks were gonna be learning the mall tyler percent on and then i'm going to recommend you the book the book is by eight yen good fellow
joshua banjo an earring core filth and it is simply called people earning is probably the most popular resource for learning deep learning it's a textbook has been long time in the works it's rather newly published but the great resource for learning keep learning now again you don't want to start this book until after you finished andrew king corsair course once you finish that course it's safe to begin right away renewed t. blurring book because deep learning is the immediate next step after shallow learn
so finished intruding course and then start on this textbook that'll put new show notes again as usual a shot threat bossi develop dot com forward slash pod casts forward slash machine learning this episode nine began lewis c. d. e. v. e. l. dot com there's also a contact but in the top right of that web page where you can get my contact information my email address twitter are linked and et cetera if your reach out to me the next
episode is gonna be about languages and fling works we're gonna talk about python versus or versus java burnet talk cancer flow versus piano versus porch all those things see you then


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash m. l. g. eight and time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks the sum which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode ten languages and frame works in this episode we're gonna talk about languages and frame
works languages like c. and c. plus plus math languages like or matt lab oct cave and juliet the g. b. m. like joplin scholar of course python framework slick c. n. l. torch and ten sir flo i'm going to give you little bit of apelike hast spoiler and that is that at the end this episode i'm going to recommend you python and spencer flow python intensive low without knowing anything about you if you're looking into machine running down my guest for you is the language python
the framework to answer float your member in a previous episode on linear regression woodhouse talking about a bias parameter athena zero without bias for energize is it says if i don't know anything about your situation i can still make a protection so if you give me a house in portland oregon and i don't have any information on its square footage number bedrooms number bathrooms etc i can still give you at least the average cost of houses in portland oregon to that
ice parameter is it's like an educated guess if you don't have any information and that's what i'm doing here my bias parameter is cancer flow and python not knowing anything else about your situation of course the details of the situation in a change that sword again into the details of why you might use one language or framework over another in this contest episode let's start right away with c. and c. plus plus c. n. c. plus plus or as close to the metal as you can get in computer programming before you go to assembly language
and below that binary language there's no way you can be riding in binary assembly so to milk the most performance that you possibly can in computer programming you'll end up using c. or c. plus plus what just so happens that machine running really needs performance machine learning is heavy heavy heavy on the computer aidid neural network costs all lots of competition resources and time and so in order to get the best performance out of your neural network c. n. c. plus plus
are the best options for you though often see this to be the case in large corporations that specialize in very computational expensive things like video games and crypt harder fi you also see it in machine learning company is very large scale or his asians like google and facebook they might use c. n. c. cost plus for their very hard for a very highly optimize machine learning algorithms there's one more new ones about c. and c. plus plus is that machine earning power grid
as our best performed on the g. p. you the graphical processing unit the reason for this is at the g. p. was specialized mac mac cooperations floating point arithmetic especially matrix algebra out remember linear algebra or really any sort of mathematical operations whether statistics calculus or linear algebra or best suited to the jeep u. n. not to seek you and c. n. c. plus plus the direct access to running your operations on
the g. p. you belie you manipulate the math directly on the jeep you which makes c. and c. plus plus the best bet for highly performance machine learning program i'm gonna throw curve ball you and say i do not recommend c. and c. plus plots as you'll see a bit we get to the python fran works these things called computational graphs or symbolic crafts when you write your code in high-level python intense or flow and it will actually be converted into c. and run directly on the g. p. you
they get the best of both worlds your coat will run again see but he gets right in the high level when was like python and you'll appreciate that because c. n. c. plus plus for very difficult programming languages very difficult to write very verbal many many lines of code to accomplish the same thing that much fewer lines of code higher level programming language which she would say a hundred lines of seagulls pasco becomes boil down to fifty lines of python coat and get a handle things like memory management stuff that you would
after normally handle in a high-level language so highly do not recommend c. and c. plus plus for machine learning programming unless you are a noble languages me feel confident in which case power to you you've actually got a lot of runway knowing those languages for a job applications or if you're working role little bit closer the metal on some really screaming performance characteristics of machine learning models basically my recommendation is that you will know when and why you need c. or c. plus plus the field
feel like you need it right now skip that malice dive into a category of languages and called the math languages mathematics languages are now lab octavia in julia these languages are very different fromm typical procedural programming languages object oriented languages or the white like python dole looks of all our is substantially different than the looks of python code are for example is highly optimize for mathematics operations
linear algebra and matrix operations are directly support in the language itself is hard to describe it you'll see things like coal ends and commas between braces of malts like to mention or raise what's called a frame for me to seize the bar the looks older we're coming from a traditional procedural programming backgrounds and what these ally you do is slice and dice major c.'s directly perform matrix algebra directly and then statistics functions like to stay
your deviation and correlation of factors or steelers are major seas are directly built into the standard library of our programming language so math is a first class citizen that really shines in the syntax of the language are also supports machine learning their robustly there are third party libraries around your alma works again you'll lot of leverage something you're taking many lines of code in its initial programming language that has do with math would really be slims down in a ball
are so are is a fantastic language for the mathematicians and as we know machine learning is nothing more than math which makes all are also a fantastic language for machine learning then there's two other languages matt loud and blockades these are direct competitors matt lau that is a commercial licensed programming language it's proprietary so if you want to use it you actually have to buy license is also actually the language of choice used in the intruding corsair
horses on fortunately but we'll have to pay for license to take that course andrew being has the code you could use for temporary license for the duration of the corsair of course will mal abascal criterion commercial octavia is a direct response to matt lab it's everything melody is but open source and fritos kind of a middle finger by freeing open-source community to the mat lab product it's kind of like what good is the photo shop if you're familiar
from what i understand it's got all little bit of the same thing going on the game has a photo shop sure isn't open-source competitor plaid it seems like matt lab stills little bit more polished now lads shines a little bit more on the linear algebra side of things that on the statistics thing from what i understand i don't really think that you would be seen matt lab in a professional capacity it's much more commonly used in academia university courses or maybe in research saw
i'll bring some simple puzzles in research before you my great you are models to a more robust solution on job a python et cetera so i wouldn't recommend taking up matt lab orbach tape on your own for your own professional purposes instead just take him out loud as it comes as necessary in your learning curriculum like that said and earrings corsair course uses now lads so you will be too don't worry the supreme minimal language dupree quick to learn and he teaches you all the basics and his course and
there's a programming language called juliann now are like i said specializes in linear algebra and statistics and calculus it has very strong mathematics foundations juliet is very similar to our but newer and slicker and sexier that has pros and cons pros being seen tactic sugar and more powerful machine learning models cons being that you really want ceylon people using it in industry yet so it's kind of a johnny come lately and pop in common
in language that i would maybe keep an eye on what hold off for now on trying to take thou language up so as far as the math languages are concerns my preferred language of this whole set is all our organs you lot of power flexibility it's open sores and it's actually quite common in industry so knowing our would be professionally advantageous now i see are used pretty commonly on the d. l. linux side of of the us
science remember from a previous episode that i said that davis science is sort of an umbrella term for various professions are fields of study one which is data mining one which is dated analysis or analytics another which is machine learning so while our supports machine learning a very robust way is so while last comment i find when looking at job postings or conversation long line then python which is a language much more common machinery space where car is more common on the day
that analysis side of things will get back to that shortly those are the math languages are now lad and octavia and julia next we enter the g. a. t. m. job of virtual machine languages job of course being the namesake for the job of virtual machine so job was the most popular of the g. b. m. languages scala being a recent contender on the space which is picking up steam in a very rapid clip style is kind of the dynamic function
old version of java with c. tactics sugar so i like to think of that is the kind of hit new start up contender on the g. b. m. java is one of those fifty year old mill manager or fancy suits languages and stolid is the big bearded coffee drinking started tipster style is a very fine programming language to program in especially its attention to functional programming functional programming is a very powerful tool in the program
school kid if you're not familiar with functional programming you will be eventually trust me it's becoming more and more of a necessity in modern programming paradigms but it is especially essential for distributed computing so discriminated feuding is the name of the game for the g. b. m. b. j. v. m. languages job and scala are meant for very very highly skilled all the high points or dado architectures by way of distributed computing of
they sell this to framework say you'll use if you're using job let them the framework of choice is how do they stay depot opie if you're using scala then the framework of choice is spark so what do the suffering works do you take in a bunch of data from the internet any pipe it into these distributed computing frame works huh due course spark an hour your insight what's called a dia pipeline or dina architecture but say that you're trying to piss
and every tweak on twitter so if you could use some sort of sentiment analysis on what is popular what is making people happy was making people in rage on twitter well consuming all that sweets from twitter would be done by way of the day architecture or indeed a pipeline through distribute computing so these would be your guys the j. v. m. languages and framework spud you pour spark you typed all the tweaked and to spark or had you and you write various nodes in this distribution
graf for processing the data so this is the mining this is the data mining piece of data science let's think of a mining analogy just so if you're mine are you going around your chisel away and you've got a bunch of or you bring into a truck and that truck brings it to a factory and factory don't sit at the receiving bay in all those onto a conveyor belt and or go through some sort of processing mechanism it gets dumped into some call john and mix of some liquid an outcome some shiny odds
that's on the other side the conveyor belt and that goes for some packaging system work it's wrapped up into a gift box and the gift box gets delivered to your machine learning our room so the data mining side or the day the pipeline of the architecture that is what the j. v. m. is all about and that is one of the three main components of data science data mining you need your data for machine learning your sheer machine learning how rhythms need to get tough launch
and when you don't want rod day that you need pre process data and if you're working with lots and lots and lots of data as an example i just used then you're gonna need to use a steel ball to shoot computing system like the duke or spark so this data mining step is all about wheeling and all your day head down into just the basics cleaning up slicing and dicing packaging up for either you're gay analysts but
are people or your machine learning people in python so that so these framework stu they take in raw data base slices and said chunks send us some soft down different conveyor belts those conveyor belts run the data through multiple processing steps in order to clean up your day and package it all up and now you have the best of the best clean day that for your date and analysts were your machine learning experts for resolve feels the d. s. science data mining dale
it's an machine learning now just to help you understand that differentiation let's go through one more example on gunny used the googled ecosystem we have google analytics and google pad sends analytics is charts and graphs it's for helping your growth hackers or you're does that make business decisions it's called business intelligence you're looking at charts and graphs to determine what sort of advertising strategy for bringing in new customers made
we need to aid the test our website in order to determine whether the button should go on the top right or the top left i think that search engine optimization is not working for the web site under this regime may we need to change the wording under certain pages to drive in more traffic just the budget charts and graphs in order for your business people to make better business decisions that speed data analysis or date analytics side of the data science package it's jobs like those that you're mostly guinness eli
which is like a bar or specializes in d. a. analysis now or can be used for machine learning and arcana also be used for data mining as you'll see in a bed every language can be used for all three prongs of the day is science umbrella what if you've determined that you wanna specialize in one capacity or another it in your best interest to choose the popular language of that ecosystem says the analytics on the machine learning silas talk about global assets and said
it determines what types of ads to show which users' based on users browsing history there prior search queries things they've clicked on in the past maybe they've sat on some amazon product page for like ten minutes really weighing the pros and cons of purchasing the arduous rest will go bill does is it tracks as much of this is a possibly can in order to determine whether the best adds to show the user in the future that's what machine learning die
is it learned some patterns by way of degas in order to make productions predicted courses of actions predicted ads classification numbers et cetera so cool analytics is like david analytics within days science go pat sense and serving piece of google is like machine learning within days science and finally we need all this day of bull fahmy analytics and the machine running side to work with and that's what data mining guys to mining polls data from some so
first slices and ices cleans up and enhance it off as a beautiful packaged your analytics or your machine learning so on these google analogy there someday a pipeline it google it's collecting every click every action a user takes lonnie user is sitting on some web page every search query all that stuff is being collected in terabytes and terabytes through the steel bull the uptight blinded the architecture by way of very likely the duke or spark now if your dinner
collection phase is very minimal if you're not collecting megabytes or terabytes of data that then you don't need a day a pipeline maybe you're just collecting data on the one time pass or maybe you're collecting cliques in actions but doesn't happen really that frequently so you don't need this major steel architecture you can just take the day as it comes slice and dice and package it all in the language that you're using weathered the python for machine learning or or for de ella next c. don't need a date architecture eat
oh needed a pipeline will know if you need it because you're trying to process watson was a degas did not turn a process got today that you don't really need this that data mining is a field of its own people specialize in data mining they know all the tricks of the trade for wet scraping breaking down day at cleaning up normalizing numerical employed and all less stuff okay so best datum ins that's what we're talking about on the g. a. t. m. so these languages nice frame works the language java
it is an older language it's more enterprising it's more robust and powerful but also very verbal oaks it's very chatty it takes a lot to do a little so stolid comes in and clean the water that up with sin tactic sugar scholar is a fresher take on java hut you is a videotape wine framework that that would go on top of java if you're using java and spark is that a pipeline framework you would use on top of scala now i believe that you can you
is how do with scala and sparked with java seeking big snatch him but i also believe it's probably a new passengers to go with the linguistics chosen as a first class citizen so you're be my recommendation is this is a greenfield project for you to call the shots in other words you get to choose the technology than to spark on scala it's simply a cleaner slicker faster sexier and you on job as sorrel lot of the mind share is and future growth in this space but you may not have a choice
maybe a point to a company may be large organization world of an older company or even new company whose developers are very well versed in the duke and java so had you on java spark on scala now one more note i said that any of these languages and airframe works can be used for any of the prongs of the of science are specializes on analytics side of things but it can certainly be used for machine learning it's actually very good for machine learning and shirt
can be used for data mining maybe not large-scale this genetic data mining secure working with terabytes or might not be the best solution but our can be used for any of these three pieces of data science similarly job i can be used of course for data mining of course on the analytic side and in machine learning by way of some modules that you would plug into your pipe line so if you're using high do on java the legacy stack then you would use the module called ma hout and a
eight h. o. we you'd see macaques that is the machine learning framework built into had to do so if you are mining data from the lab was save scraping some information off web pages an eap type against your factory in it gets caught up in the pieces and it gets massage been cleaned up normalized packaged up and sent to the last module or note of your day a pipeline which is the machine learning piece you would use macaques to use java how do
and my count on the scala stack you you scala spark spark for the day the pipeline framework scholars the programming language and then your final note of the pipeline for machine learning is called spark am at all and all for machine running so spark an owl so if your specialty is data mining with maybe a little bit of machine running sprinkled in the meeting go this route but if your specialty is machine learning with maybe some analytics and data mining
sprinkled and then that brings us to python python python is the most highly recommended it and most popular language of choice for machine learning engineers if you know anything about python then you may be thinking why the hell is python the most popular language for machine running as a way back in cac plus plus we need to the metal screaming performance for machine learning models we it's ron on the jeep you we wanna steal
data mining pipeline distributed across multiple computers python's as seem like a good fit for any of this python is a dynamic language that is if i dare say rather slow it's not functional sodas and distribute your lays low scala hears what python has going for it python can handle any of these tasks we v.'s by way of either a domain specific language or a framework okay so let's start with the math languages are 'em out loud and oct
aid and julia has python stack up to those languages for supporting mathematics as a first class field within the language of language doesn't support mathematics out well at the box instead you use these libraries called number high end pandas and you and p. why and pandas intellect or a panda nom de hi is sort of python's the answer to matt lab so numb pie gives you at the box including the syntax the coal ends and
the commons the way you slice across major seats all the operations that now lads supports so blown using python we just crossed out one entire language can as gives us all the same functionality that are gives us not not whole way not completely of course or isolde more robust to unfold community backing behind it but most of the way there as far as we're concerned isn't she in learning engineers all that we could possibly need so don't we just cross out are not
python my give us lots of other things that we might need in our didn't hire solution of a star up or some sort of wet service such as the server weary use flask or jane go and conductivity cure database to see pulled out to me so it fits into read the rest of the architecture of your company without having to no other languages and framework to just fits right in how about a pipeline a messing with something that was very well suited to java well guess what sparked supports python

's you can use python for sparks a bomb which is cross out the whole g. b. m. section we have data quite gliding through pie spark we have mathematical operations through numb high in pandas okay and is one thing left performance we're talking about how it compares to c. n. c. plus plus you need your operations to ramona jeep you cannot see view that's where framework comment fiato torch and spencer flo what they hinge
reduced to python is a paradigm called a computational graf weren't symbolic graf why you do is you write your neural networks in the framework like to answer flow in python anticancer flow packages up what you just wrote it walks down the stairs to the basement and gives it to see this as your c. what your real rate this in optimal way for you to execute him as c. environment
see look so what you wrote intensive flow and python any kind of turns around and it's hands and have titles to itself mrs newbie their real writes it because it knows a better way to run things and it turns around the open sea out and pops in the oven that's your jeep you successor flow takes a python code converted to see and runs it directly on the g. p. you and when the avon's finished it pulls out see gives it back to python and python gives it back to you so there you have it don't we just blew see out of the equation
python handles everything that's why python is so popular and she nineteen eighty is not because the language itself stacks up to any of these other languages in fact it doesn't however libraries and framework swore it in the pipeline ecosystem can replace all these other paradigms very effectively so python gives you your full day of science stack from data mining today analytics to machine learning know will say that if you apply to the job
the data analyst or if you apply to a job as a day as india minor you will still find the g. b. m. or maybe are used for donnelly in those particular burke calls but for a company which supports the whole process a tizzy in which you might be spanning the full stack of jaded science python is certainly the most popular in common language and ecosystem that you'll see in the space most of the jobs i see when scanning the job market machine learning are certainly python jobs and again it's nothing
the language itself it's all in the ecosystem the libraries and modules they're available the python ecosystem that make davis science completely span of all from a to z. by way of a single language so let's talk about these frame works for soft like us said we have not high in pandas non pie gives you a little bit of the quick and dirty matrix operations it's sort of the answer to matt lab and pandas it gives you all sorts of statistics operations summaries analytics watson graf sobered
ada a bunch of operations on a day shocker called a deed of frame silesia to libraries are your commonly see in the python tool kit another libraries called psychic learned as c. i. a. take aidid latest scientific kids and this is a bunch of scholl learning our rhythms available for python showing our rhythms like we're aggression logistic regression support vector machines and be seen in france driving cars anything you could possibly name in the machine running you know
first i think you'll find that the majority of your machine learning more professionally in academically will tends towards people earning is not in the beginning of definitely by the end so most of the work begun be doing a machine learning will be done indeed learning neural networks from prior episode so once we graduated deep learning you can all longer use psychic learn instead of you move on to one of the suffering works these framework cy mentioned previously democratic categorize under the umbrella of con
a. t. show graphs or symbolic graphs one more time let me explain what the strain works do you write your code in python within the framework to architecture sees the framework speak yeah i let's say to build out the neural network let's say the u. creating new objects that sent in sense and you're all my work and you call a few methods off of that object adding new layers and noon your arms and you add the final operation which is that propagation which will perform create a sense and then
you feed a bunch of degas to train them at work upon and then you say objects dot go or session dot ryan or some other incarnation like that and what happens now is python by way of ten sir flow or whatever framework to use will head off what you've written to see see will assess what you've given it and rewrite it if necessary if it finds it can optimize it's execute the saying on the g. p. you and then give you your results
and assess that reseda c. may decide to optimize what you have written this whole set may sound familiar to you if you've ever worked with reacts natives as a mobile that developer reacts native lets you write your mobile happen in java script okay the language being shot a script and the framework being react and the framework on compilation will then pass what you've written down to the android by way of java and iphone by way of that
it's the worst left and those respective languages will make optimization says necessary and then compile your code down to native mobile code okay so that's on the mobile space if you ever made a video game with the unity is very similar you write your game in a high level framework and it gets compiled down with you ever use and objects relational mapping system and a bowl r m for databases may be using ruby on rails or jane go when you do is you write your sequel
queried by way of the framework you're not actually writing any eskew well you said you're running a bunch of functions passing in parameters and any hit go and all our am will do some analysis of what you were in no optimize it and you'll get out some stuff that son of cereal added some new stuff that might make things slow the faster and then they will turn it into the eskew well language so transform your python or you're just a coded into sequel and and sequel will accede to the codes is exactly what how
and in with these computational raskin python you write your python with any of these frame works piano torch were cancer flow the frame works optimize it and compiler down see executed on the jeep you and therefore you get screaming performance with a high level expressive language very slick indeed highly recommended approach to machine learning is also by way of these fireworks that most of the mind share and research and progress is happening especially to answer full up but
for week in the tens of flow let's cut it take a historical approached these friend works will start with piano t. h. e. a n. o. as far as i know fiato is the oldest of these computational graf when works was built out at the university of montreal were a lot of mine share was going on especially in the early days of deep learning making a comeback with jeffrey and sinatra badge all those guys so that was sort of the hotbed physically in the universe of machine learning research was in march
we all suffering work came out of it's called fianna and it supported sending mathematical operations down to see and from c. to the jeep you and all the way back got that's the competition on graft and wallet was used almost exclusively for machine learning it didn't initially support machine learning directly with more on the math side of things so the community bill third party modules once called blocks and another one's called lasagna supplied another layer on top of piano for coal
the machine learning tasks like linear regression and logistic regression so massive was built on the shah learning side we still lay that a high level expressive language for the deep learning side of things and so another layer on top was built called khabarovsk haiti or kate acts so fiato is more of an ecosystem that that individual framework if you use the fiato ecosystem you will be using the fiato framework indeed and any number of other modules on top five
find personally and this might get me into trouble that fianna looks to be going out of vogue to its competition namely torch anticancer flux i think the enters a little bit more history to hold or well over time it became more common to use very research heavy experimental deep learning architecture is like a calm the net seal and the heat heat for c. n. n. or convolution all neural network you've already seen this month prior episode about vision
c. n. n.'s are very good at classifying images cons net will turn out that piano was in great maybe at handling something a little bit more obscure like that so facebook create a competitor symbolic graf based framework called torture and torch particularly specialize in the image recognition by way of consonants and of course it handled any other sort of incarnation above neural networks and other machine in paradigms and the math at the lower level etc you see wife is that
be so interested in continents image recognition is their specialty please have your friends in this photo that's what face books all about so facebook is the king of the machine learning universally coms two image recognition specifically to something that courtroom from the get go was very very good at accomplishing incidentally the framework torch was written on lula tells you okay i've never heard of that language up until torch of never see
it anywhere else and i'm sure that they experience that kind of reaction in their community as well because they recently released a python the p. i'm so now you can do torch in python starting to see a trend here he wanna play with the big dogs in machine learning you have to support python as so we saw was sparked spark released a python rapper because when they were stuck in the j. v. m. they realized they were really missing out on a major markets of developers sophie eno and mentor
shh and then finally a new player has answered tense or flo tv and escobar best though or dub you tend to flow by google it facebook has an active interest in it image recognition in classification global has an active interest in machine learning period in fact if you haven't made this realization yet you will google is the god of machine learning of the universe everything they could possibly be
machine learning problem global needs to solve its language modeling in natural language processing for processing your search crews knowledge representation for coming up with a response your search crews image recognition by way of google images voice recognition with all their voice services on mobile reinforcement learning in their self driving cars anything you could possibly name in the machine running universe and especially the nation's only around her but statistics in calculus
in a middle layer you can work and denominator amongst their various teams trying to solve these problems the framework they use and built to answer flow on top of python i don't know if it was that people realize who google kazan the machine learning equation or if it's it's answer flow itself is a superior framework bowen says airflow is released people flocked into role in droves tend to float is barn on the most
killer or machine running framework on the face of the planet the most talked about most commonly used in courses in get how projects boilerplate stuff new and interesting research and projects tense airflow is little the similar to this piano ecosystem inez supports various layers on the lowest larry you have basic math operations and we're out of statistics in calculus in the middle layer you can work with wrong machine learning algorithms and constructs an anaconda heil
i told you can write neural networks with various architectures in a very expressive manner there's another option to go even higher than that with care rocks remembered the top level of the fiato stack you can put that tax on cancer flow as well you get a little bit even more high level expressive neural network capabilities to cancer flow has a little bit of a history it actually had some major performance issues in the early days
if you look up to answer flow performance and you find any articles from two years ago or one year ago even you'll find performance comparisons between tester flow torch and fiato and you'll see that sensor flawless loses however because tester flow uses that computational graf system the code that you writes is not the code is executed and so the ten to fourteen was able to optimize begin between the python goes down to see step and of course the jeep you stuff and a milk doubt that performance and that's answer flow is
one of the most if not the most performance machine running framework on the market to answer flow also has built into it's the capability for running distribute computation in other words you wouldn't even have to use spark if you use tend to focus it's built into cancer flow by way of something called cancer flow serving and finally a tense airflow goes beyond just compiling down from python to see into the jeep you're on your computer you can war on cancer flow on mold
all on an android or python device so the building amal bled to death machine learning and as some way we can do some of the medium to a minimal level compute resources models on that uses device directly let's say for example image detection are taking image and it will maybe highlights persons silhouette separating them from the background or something like that can be run for requiem all of ice making kick off your more caught the facial expensive operation struck with a tense or flow server successor fool
oh really is powerful arise everywhere he runs any sort of machine learning model honor this on including worker neural networks which is something a lot of these other framework struggled with for awhile and reinforcement learning which is really getting us into the artificial intelligence territory reinforcement remember i said is that gave way it takes you from sheen learning and didn't you pay either reinforcement like and sensor flow supports reinforcement learning models directly okay so if you decide on sensor flowing python which i
suggest you do you'll have the option to compile sensor flow to run only on your seek you or on your jeep you so few doing to answer flow on your laptop for work and you don't have a very powerful g. p. you you can just come pilot to run on your c. p. one whale it's slower of course ever very very heavy architectures it's been a very slow but for your server on an eight of us cluster of taking x. jeep use etc you've course will compile its ron on the g. p. a tense airflow supports out of the box and the biaggi
he used and it is sort of kings and the jeep you space of handling machine learning and deep learning computations on g. p. a date on it they know that machine running framework c. u. c. p. you and so they've actually written drivers for their jeep use so that machine learning models can run more seamlessly on their devices they do this by way of something called couldn't see you da and i don't really know what asked as far better than if you look at who dies says parallel distributed computing platform applegate
and anyway this for running a heavy math on your jeep you and then an additional layer called coup de n. n. c. u. d. n. n. n. n. is specifically for running neural mel works on a jeep you so they haven't interface the driver for machine learning framework psyched to answer flow to interface with directly there g. p. use soap incidentally if you actually are looking for hardware you may want to target and the act instead of that amd because they have these interfaces okay so that so
lay of the land of the python machine learning frame irks we have fiato torch and cancer flow now there are plenty of other machining frame works out there are many many machine and fireworks on going to give you a handful of some of the more common we mentioned was on wine was called cafe it's raining cac plus plus and it is interface is c. and c. plus plus so you're not to be using cafe in the pipeline ecosystem as far as i know it's a little bit old and dying sonoma their recommend cafe
for anyone really i may be wrong there take that with a grain of salt do some research c. n. t. k. is a framework put out by microsoft annex nets put out by amazon k. i'm haven't really seen c. n. t. k. or pemex nets in the wilds on job postings on line tutorials or any of that cell and then there's deep warning for jay if you're using job of using the j. p. m. stack particularly if you're coming from a high duke or spark stacked in yuma
you want to use java for your machine learning framework as well and so there's a framework called deep learning for jake this is actually a very popular framework is very powerful and the word for it being in job i was put into the framers comparisons it's a bit is on par as far as popularity goes to maybe the likes of the hour torch but it's in the job and ecosystems are very par for popular framer called deepening for j. and then there's another forever proud that you'll see a lot called open c. v. c. b. stands for computer
jim and it this is really just for computer vision so you'll know if you need this framework don't seek it out for its own rights computer vision can be handled with convolution all male mao works which are architecture that come along with cancer fluffy anno torches cetera so that's languages and free works at my recommendation to use python and spencer flow ma'am i'm going to post a handful of particles that you can see people comparing languages and framework for machine running purposes
where got a lot of this information i've also got a lot of my information from job hunting and from talking to call aches and for the resources section okay you need to know python team into machine learning your unfortunate we learn math lab first if you starting with the tangerine corsair course adult kind of be a throwaway programming language but it's okay because that language isn't very difficult to record at around python the whole bit more difficult because it's all the more robust as a lot more to know when the python ecosystem to veto power
you know python and i would recommend picking up a python book called too little research myself on amazon in all pop one into the show notes to learn python first and then were intense sir flow now there's books and is online courses and is video series on cancer flow and i've consumed a handful of various media for tessa for myself but the thing that i actually found to be the best resource for learning center flow was actually just the documentation on the website dictatorial support there
a thorough of course the roy's opted which is something that one of these other media can achieve that they have very thorough tutorials to go along with cody thin and examples folder of the tense or flow project itself that you can reference so i highly recommend to the tester flow tutorials and that is it for this episode friends see you next time


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash and algae and it time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. you're listening to me she learning applied in this episode or talk about practical clustering tools
for the usual difference between machine and died and zhang applied will be talking body theory about clustering or how these clustering our burdens work and justin be talking about some of psychic weren't packages and some of the tips and tricks that i've found useful in actually applying clustering techniques in no sea and hopefully in a future machining guide episode will talk about the theory behind some of the schools and clustering in general etc now the first
cold i'm going to talk about is psychic learned cade means everyone knows k. means k. means is just the most popular clustering arbor them f. or just ever it's everyone uses it ninety nine percent time for clustering they're using k. means an effect by just recommends trying k. means first if you need to close your vectors try k. means that if it works great if not then you move on to basically the other twelve volt
talk about in this episode has came means worked on it generally in practice not to talk about theory idle what talk about how the sand troy to move around and in the points shift in all the things more talk about in practice you'll be using this psychic learned clustering decaying means package and you'll specified upfront a number of clusters so let's say you have a thousand doctor satcher matrix thousand by ten ten being the number two
mentions her vector in your matrix well you would need to know in advance how many clusters you're going to be clustering you're matrix into that will happen is you'll say k. means parentheses and underscore clusters equals number of questions and the case of a thousand factors medulla say can attend clusters essence brigham and forensics or other hyper planners in the k. means package that will be discussing and they'll say don't fit or die
they predict your michio procedure matrix and they will return to you the labels the kloster assignment which cluster each robot assigned to sophie out of thousands rose you'll get a list of a thousand numbers between one and ten now i mention reason she lying that absurd the euclid in distance does not perform well in high dimensions and k. means is effectively using
the euclid ian distance metric on rutledge in order to move its ports around or good fine of central it's been no see the journal entries and that it's the same sentence transformers and bedding tool or seven hundred and sixty eight dimension factors that is too high for k. means to work effectively it is too hot as far as i understand it from from poking around on one when we say too high of dimensions for came
means to kloster effectively for euclid ian distances to work well we're talking like a hundred hundred dimensions is like push and things and we really want something like ten ted fifty dimensions that's really are sweet spot so he seven hundred and sixty eight dimension vectors is just right out to wait to high for k. means to work fantastically now i have used k. means in no fee in practice
as for okay it's not terrible an effective ego to know the ai dock on now sign up by korea few journal entries in and go to the incites page or you can generate themes all over your entrance of the journal entries themes in no feet or clusters the clusters by their clusters on your journal entries i'm in other words i talk about relationships law and i talk about politics a lot what may start out as a thousand journal entries be coms two clusters in
and the fiends section of no see they will show you add the key words the common keywords it up here or in kloster won in this case it would be politics tromp collections blah blah blah as well as a summary of the core of that feed using their own party face transformers summers asian pipeline and then it seemed to aka a cluster to 'cause we're using clustering baseball teams are purchased the clustering feature in practice theme
two might have the words relationship bands marriage in ali's things and then a summer's a shove the centuries you can on the website click the advanced into your icon and select k. means to be your clustering algorithm behind the scenes uses a bomb or a classroom which will talk about a bit and you can see the results i have found the k. means for this purpose for natural language processing and bedded documents now seven hundred sixty eight to mention vector very high dimension
actor clustering those does not work fantastically with came into works okay it's not terrible but i have personally found that the blomberg of clustering works better and will talk about that nugget but before we talk about that no k. means is the most popular clustering our rhythm on the planet's celeste while you're alone but more there are other implementation zaki means you don't have to use the psychic learned package a very popular other implementation of came into this the fights have a bypass s. is a facebook me
she learning package and it has it's own implementation of k. means which is actually faster it's as more performance and it actually is more accurate evidently after you train it's on very large gate and so the psychic learn k. means package works effectively for low to medium data and talk about numbers of rose not dimensions and the fights k. means implementation by facebook works better for reward the number of rose bowls computational a performance why
and accuracy performance was what this package feist die is not i will talk about this concept in another episode because it is highly related to no fee on actually using fights were any of these related packages but i will eventually and i think it will be of interest you listeners feist they call this approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm for packages and as a handful powder one is thrice won it is annoying eight and anatole why yeah exactly annoying and
and another one is h. m. s. dub you live to ann's you'll find if you wanted flooded into these now 'cause i'm will be talking to much about them currently is your final of the more bobby's actually go to the u. k. p. lab sense transformers package which is good but school i use a nosy four and getting your documents and in the examples directory there's code that uses these packages in discusses what they do and why you would use them calm so if you wanna get clicks
and identity sings i recommend going to the u. k. p. lives and transformers examples directory doing a little poking around but in essence what these packages do these approximate nearest neighbors algorithms is they are they're used for semantic search for looking things up just like you use co sign similarity and i can using co signed some larry you know she bought it for very very very large date set six to ring large days such millions of rose what the what these packages do
ooh that was just take fights for example fights creates an index basically your database all of document and denning says an index of these documents so you instead she an index of python code index equals five stock index princes and then you see in all of your doctor and petting zoos raul seven hundred sixty dimension factors into the index an index chris databases base of the effectively with a postscript database firm icicle database is a data base all of the factors that can
and being swamped in and out of disk and memory very computation we effectively and which indexes the the location in vector space all these documents to each other where you get to specify what is that distance mack truck by which these are compared to each other for look upon me and acts so if you're using doctor and eddings you care about close as alert as we discussed in the distance not accept some dark him bearings care about co sign similarity twitchell
urso you specify enough ice index cure my documents million of them and the similarity magic on what is co sign similarity now you have an index that is used for extremely efficient look up and search and annex anyhow the document so for devil by half a million books being my fight spandex and now i have a new journal entry that there are no thing i could say finding the top ten books matching his journal entry he just thrown into the spice index and it returns to
you can results which using the similarity magic a specified in this case because signed is able to just project your journal entry into vector space and these odd points these books are represented competition we officially can be just hold out really fast easy unawares relates to k. means is that if he does this fight a distance metric this could be using euclid indices metric everything noises you put in by default guinier's just like the dutiful distance master come everything and the d. fault
lost or is bikinis are written about fleiss's implementation of the king's opera i'm so the fleiss package primary utility is this approximate nearest neighbor search which allows you to do semantics turks between vectors you can vary computational efficient we pulled up similar vectors to wanna you passes for very large data sets but one side benefits of feist is that it uses its own implementation of the king is our them on the hood in order to perform this process it also exposes that
he means implementation to use a developer which you can then use for your own just normal clustering application for very large data sets so that's k. means the psychic learned package for small to medium data sets the fights package for large data sets and came in search of uses euclid in distances is part of its algorithm under the hood but like i said you quit in distance doesn't bode well in high dimensions and indeed with document eddings as we're using no see we're dealing with higher dimensions so what you do
yeah a couple of options one thing you could do is to mention aladeen read duke's your lord vectors and i will be a very nearer upcoming episode in machine on applies to men johnny reduction there's all sorts of dimension ellie reduction our burdens out there one is p. c. a consultant on analysis another is best vp another day is you map and cease me now to see is low but more commonly used for visualization purposes but you map and t. c. balls
or what's called manifold him bettors and are they can be used for to mention audi reducing your lord factors to very small to mention vectors are taking the case of t. c. two to three components down from seven hundred sixty eight and a case of you map you get specify however many components we won't talk about demand shelly reduction here that'll be in the upcoming episode and i'm not using them as shelly reduction know see instead i'm using a different class ring our remote
which supports different similarity metrics for determining the clusters of your roads and mainly as a mention in the similarity magic's episode in an l. p. co sign is almost always prefer over you putting distance anyway us not just that high dimensions don't perform as well as not the only reason we're not using k. means here it's that in the case of an l. p. euclid in distance which sort of driving force behind k. means doesn't really make sense
the distance metric in semantics search and co signers preferred presence comforts okay means is pre much kicks to the curb in this particular case of an opaque high dimensions check you clay and check when lawn and the place that diana planning on is what the law murder of cluster of blomberg of clustering tanaka spell it gets along word ago on more active you look at the shots of glory of posturing is a tape of hierarchical clustering it's a different set for later for style of clustering arbor them
no way k. means works these hierarchical clustering of rooms there's all sorts of different prayer book of clustering of rhythms and there are a lot of other question now grooms better or the hierarchical necessarily is wop bop a few out there that i've seen commonly used our best spectral clustering mean shift affinity propagation and some other question algorithms i will discuss ms episode don't discuss the three bears mentioned by the coup hair below cost
during works turrell a difference in the way k. means works and her pull clustering our rhythms are more friendly to using different similarity metrics honor the hood for clustering your day yet in our case for they say we want co signed k. means doesn't use co sign infected s. ne win support co signed and so in no see we're using a type of hair couple clustering algorithm called on kulon word of caution i won't talk about how cool
armored of clustering works mostly to actually don't understand it now while it is so happens to really work well for me in practice and i've tried a handful of their hair go posturing our burdens on guam report the best for me so so wanna go with but i will say technically that the way allows you to use the course i'm metric is that allows you to pass in a man's shirt by name so's you'd say secular not clustering topical armory of parentheses that number is
foster's yours as a number of clusters in the second learned that clustering packages so we have a thousand entries maybe ten cluster sounds good comma and then met church the polls and then you can specify work one which i believe supported is the word co sign like i may or may not be wrong about that are not actually using that amusing at a different one the metric stirring that i'm using is called pre computed pre computed el what that does is that they
specs you not only to pass in the day that the roads that you're going to be clustering but also a day another matrix and that matrix is the distance of every row to every other rob yeah because we're comparing every row to every other ro what we end up having is what we call it square matrix a square matrix is the same number of rose by columns all of it babe
i call of the sodas lot of repeated dia obviously but that's what these hierarchical algorithms which allow you to pass in the pre computed distance matrix expect is a matrix nautilus or a vector emma like emma matrix am being the number of rose in your date set so you pray compute the co sign similarity in all that every entry come begging by every other country i'm betting m. when you get back is
a square matrix of all 'cause i'm similarities and you pass an end to the aboard of clustering constructor function and then you called top fit transform on your country combat inks and when you get back is again ellis dove labels though less length being the length of your list of entries and ole ole values being any number in the range of the number of clusters the specified be ten in this example are going to puke the square matrix of the co signed distances from every and
three i'm betting to every other country and adding does have the sienna code i'm using pie torch to normalize although vectors first and then computed doc products right immense man in the similarity metrics episode the co signed similarity function can be approximated as the normalized doc products of two factors in the resided without way as high torching norm then doc product is that is actually really fast you can do this on the jeep you
ooh normalization and doc product or balls to extremely fast very first class implementation audience linear algebra on a jeep you can itself or as if you're to use one of a psychic learn co signed distance functions like that he'd jest or seed just methods i would be performed on the c. p. you annie would be slower okay so that's the k. means algorithm which uses euclid insistence on rid of that compared to the o. glorious clustering algorithm which
the type of hierarchical clustering algorithms which allows you to specify whenever by distance metric he wants and our case we're using the cosa somewhere in magic we don't just how what he used the co sign some learning magic for technical reasons using the string magic the polls close side is that we pre computer co sign similarity into it a twenty square matrix of babe i'd be co scientists insist that we do that by a calculating the norm of every vector and there
narcotics against each other norm to dock products is effectively co sign next sort of talk about deed the stand and h. t. b. stand up before we do on what to talk about finding the number of clusters to use in your clustering algorithm because like i said both k. means and aguilar of clustering expect you to pass an independent underscore clusters parameter being the number of questions your class jury roar the large data set down in
to buy honey no advance you might know you might actually know that there are three topics on this website three news topics politics sports and beauty read those of the three top of the only three topics we talked about on this website so no matter how many news oracles we publish it for abusing a clustering our brother milner cluster down to three and crushers go through this very rarely the case that you know it as the number of clusters you need for this clustering application so there are on a mad
ways for finding the number of clusters the first way sir do what we call that elbow approach that can show you this weren't contests format is a very visual think what happens is there's a point at which you start getting diminishing returns in in what we call in nerve shot will talk about that a bit and you can graft that autograph and you'll see that point is very crystal clear what happens is you try every number of clusters up until you start getting diminishing returns soap which write one caught up
i was in rose was strike clustering this into one okay we get back was called in their ship which plot that point on a graph and then we say how much you clusters we clustered those thousand rose into two postures and then we'd be back the inertia and we put that on a graph we keep on three classes for questions so what were the graph end up looking like is this witness we lease steep fall and then like that elbow of us a point where this is again angle it really stocks following an integral well
some goes to the late much much more local still decreasing but must much less rapidly we call at the elbow and that's the point at which she huge aside venture optimal number of clusters now you could do that by a actually creating a graph embassy tutorials teach you that approach literally your rate through wanted to forty or half the number of rosen your date set and jerry clusters for that number of clusters
get the inertia back corner autograph make the graph look at the graph eyeball the although what seems to be a good elbow and then manually you the programmer choose that to be your pen clusters i don't like that approach awake i know what the humans are being in the next year in that way i eyeball even visualization of the data sets and distributions in making judgment calls on how to normalize you day and stuff like this but i don't believe that humans to be in the mix in this particular way i initially automated and there is a pair
the job they're called need to take any he'd he'd be like need instead of elbow because that is that if if the king can graft is pouring concave up with common and although as his concave down we call in the so they decided to go with me and said although maybe it'll blow was our uses a package need with the d. a n. p. d. what they need a package does allows you to just automatically finding the elbow or the knee deep i have full piper
amateurs and which direction are we supposed to be pouring concave up convex down blah blah you specify those things and and you give it the graph that would have otherwise been generated in visual output you just get those points and it finds the need for you automatically very handy to late so need to talk to me locator parentheses your points and some fiber parameters edible find that elbow for you but those points on the graph outside inertia inertia less discusses
little bit the inner shot of the k. means model is the intro kloster distance between clusters it says the distance between clusters between clouds of dots okay so we'd use you say she became means model with with a number of course jersey specified to for example and then you fit transform it on your rose any remembers is a it's a variable now on the quay means model it's a public variable you can access
hold inertia that it is the distance between the two clusters the two clouds of dots the demean square distance between these two dots or does distance be euclid intestines okay will trivia from our distance metrics epps are so as to mean distance between clusters you add a third closer now it's distances between all three classes for each other so that inertia and is stored on the instead she became means model which is a very warner python could eat his access as mottled by inertia and
just a number can you just thrown into a snake pop that into your into your knee locator code which will and find elbow for you but there is an alternative method of fine amy optimal number of questions is not inertia is called the silhouette score silhouette score it takes into consideration both into her candidate in shrine clustered distances so it takes into consideration the distance of points in a cluster to their cluster sanford
and the desist from kloster to cluster so it's all little bit more informed to to what they have loaded more information packed into what provides you back and in addition it does something extra which is that the maximum silhouette score is the winner is the optimal number of clusters to joe's which is better than using this new locator approach because finding the elbow of a graph
can be a little bit fuzzy and are hyper parameters that you have to pass into this new locator algorithms of that you find the right elbow given the types of graphs that you're getting back to the particular is one hibor primer called s. which is the sensitivity howell sensitive or you to the spell those if he ever to smooth over graf we need to up the sensitivity so that it's a little bit more hardcore and if if it's a very jagger aphid sarah
so finding the elbowed graft is usually not all very cotton try to be subjective into the physique and it might be looted automated techniques like the new locator where's the silhouette score has to benefits overusing inertia for finding the optimal number of cluster fuck came means or glamour clustering the first benefit is that the information that is packed into this process namely in turk can't inge frock cluster distances
is more informative when it comes to deciding optimal number clusters you have more information to help you make a decision on the optimal number of questions and the second benefits is that you can't simply select the silhouette score there is a maximum as that represents your papa mama murph clusters and is no complicated physique new locator logic you have to do to find the elbow so nine time that can you see people prefer to use this
so what score and as a psychic learned silhouette score function it just makes whole process super easy for you and there's one third huge benefit is that allows each you pass again a pre computed square matrix of distances so you can use the silhouette score with co signed distances for deciding the number of often low-cost years in a blomberg of clustering so let's take a little step back k. means model you
it is you claim descent center that that has problems of high dimension as probably because it can use goes on so in an l. p. applications k. means isn't the best arbor them to use here in most other applications k. mean is that the fall and is a great crossing aren't used the specifically in this case documented eddings and cosa similarities high dimension and weep for crossfire over euclid in seoul can really use k. means and is decaying means model that generates the spender show
score when you're on the model on some number of clusters so we don't have the inertia score we can even use inertia scores are available to us we're using the ago on word of clustering our room which does not come with inertia score sell what we do we run the egg lot more of quest for for every number of clusters from some minimum to a maximum and then we actually compute the sole wet score for this the same square make
it's a co signed distances between the documents that we use as the da to train you go on earth clustering our burden on we use as the input for the pre computed distances for the silhouette score dose of silhouette score method takes the labels that are al public fromm do cloth for hand the distances themselves being in this case the pre computer matrix cousins and words so so as far as fantastic phenomenal is preferred in most
this is for stands for finding the optimal number of clusters either for k. means or for a lot of questions article clustering wherever have you and so for most applications where recommend is you go k. means and you go solo escort and dictum axel s. were that's the number of clusters of tiny fine minimal the optimal number of clusters jamie's and psychic learned if your day is small to medium to amy's from fights if you did his lord's hands you'll use the silhouette score
to find the optimal number of clusters for your kamins that's most applications born on talking about was that occasions you were talking about natural language processing so our case we're using the uncooperative clustering our rhythm with which works well with pre computed square distance nature c.'s whatever that may be in our case is co sign and then you can use the silhouette score on at the idea of glory of clustering i'll put in combination with the pre computer koh samet jerks so k. means and
ron rapoport us only our burdens out there and there are different popular ones used by different circles but in my opinion i like those two cars remember and sebastian eileen out talk about the beast gan and h. g. b. scan aidid be scan is another type of higher poll posturing our brim similar to the bomber clustering being a type of particle clustering our burdens of didi skin is another article plus for an effect it seems to be bombed and this is just my observe
haitian allow more popular on the internet just use a lot more commonly in paris applications ulysses to be the case that the law the community is moving away from k. means and sports guy de be scanned it seems that the big whenever didi scan as part of this special sauce under the hood offers a lot of versatility that lends itself to multiple applications and sort of auto learns some aspects as per the process one aspect being the number of clusters
sell big benefit if you use didi scan you don't need to specify the number of clusters it learns it defines the optimal number of clusters for you on it is on that he is being norman sets in a huge resented tuesday be scan over either buckle armor of clustering for k. means now dna scan is often algorithm it said concepts and so there's a psychic or implementation
called psych you learned our clustering not the bees can probably well there's a bomb more popular implementation are called h. d. b. scan that is just as his son on psychic or implementation and is suspicious more populous more powerful has lot of bells and whistles that does lot more for you and the box lot of great argumentation a huge community behind it tom so if you're gonna used to be skinner recommend using the h. d. b. stand package instead it is not
or the psychic learn package and yeah so let us send out one of the benefits of the staircase to be stan's a automatically learns a number of clusters off the mall for your clustering situation and another big benefit is that it's the sort of a bill on automatic next to it it is sort of does some stuff on rue the day o'connor said i haven't spent much time with it that it lends itself generally to various specific use cases where you would specifically be
using specialized arbor and so me personally been no see i am specifically using a gourd of clustering because it specifically line as well to the pre compute co signed somewhere in the matrix being passed and and and working off that can find it to work very well whereas detainees are brittle abuse over here for some other stuff stuff that you put in an ox language it should well kgb stand for what i understand what his great strengths is that it's
alluded more general and mall to play up little boy you can use it across the board honor various circumstances and it can handle multiple of these various circumstances very well i would recommend exploring the stevie skin and if you're doing clustering in your application and seeing how well works for you it's it's a very popular and people swear by people law they stevie scan me personally i'd try it in no fee for the themes feature and for clustering your journal entries the buffer
running goes through that semantic similarities surfed books even worth all for a fight i've filled with it for hours and hours they never found it any clusters was always native one which means it didn't didn't find any that the only cluster found was native one which means it was now liar i don't know if it's just that the da oh i'm using yielded good document and betting speed seven hundred and sixty eight dimension factors are all know if i need to normalize as an advance or
or confessed to ohio's dimensions of factors as far as i understand another claim of tasty be scanners is it doesn't matter the dimension of vectors using her to be wrong about that one but is supposed to be what is a catch all clustering our rhythms it can basically handle anything but it was not able and all my dana without bail and always document and bangs whatsoever neither didi skin from secular nor gauge the beast in the stand on package with all the filling of hyper parameters and
not to mention ali reducing my vectors not always sings i can get working with subsides move ahead conglomerate question was working just fine for us are stuck to my parents saw not using it but i do recommend you try it because people swear by it so cheney is confident that the faults beast the beast ghana's to catch all and conglomerate clustering is nice because it it allows you to go sour and any other pre computed metric you might be using this not you plug in base that's it for today
some will talk about doctor actually who will change and pace from the types of staff wouldn't talk about really see you then

or is shallow learning algorithms shallow learning to remember a previous out so we talked about people earning we talked about using neural networks which is kind of the quintessential people earning concepts as sort of a silver bullet approach you can use neural networks for classification for aggression you can use of earlier situations with features don't need to combine any news them for non their situations were features may need to combine in some special way maybe this is smaller act
three squared plus x. to transact swan says feature learning any other piece of deep learning is the hierarchical representation of the day it's learned some breaking down face into its apart spies becomes lines and angles and those become pixels by also said that while we may treat people earning is sort of a silver bullet isn't necessarily so in fact if you talk to the machine expert feel very much aggravate and to see the level to which new machine mining engineers are treating
learning as silver bullet is to promise was thinking of the pudding is a silver bullet one is that it's certainly is not a silver bullet you can't use no met works for everything there are still many situations for which people earning cannot be applied and two if you have a problem that fits the bill up shall earning power grid and just sell been your point to save immensely on time and resources deep learning is extraordinarily computation only expensive so always using your own mel works saw
all everything means time in mind when something to the news new problem for much cheaper to having a basic knowledge of the fundamental scholl learning machine running our rhythms most commonly used in the space is very essential when you embark on your machine learning journey learning machine learning you're going to be learning these shallow learning approaches first to understand a baseline of how machine and works before you dive into the deep end of deep learning i like it said in a prior up
so it all lot of scholl learning our problems can be used as a team you're on in a deep learning architecture column but some of them can be so we are going to discuss the high level overview of various scholl learning algorithms summer the most common ones that i personally see werner do so because having an understanding of all these different approaches is essential for your development is a machine learning engineer balls and being able to apply the right
too old to the right job especially as situations were deep learning cannot be used and also to the u. be equipped with more computational eat fish and our rooms for situations where a particular algorithm fits the bill just so now i want to warn you there are hundreds of machine learning algorithms out there who hundreds machine learning for the longest time was this space exploration of mathematical loquacious statistical formulaic trying to discover which
algorithm would fit what situation if your problem was probable estate he might you something like the scene inference be fewer data mining association rules on the market basket approach you might use something like pop reorder worried it's always a bit for all sorts of different strokes for different folks different heart rhythms for different situations and so much so that almost every particular type this situation warrants in a particular type of algorithm is created the quest for the master algorithm this is like dick
asked for the grand unification fury in physics and mention the mass for our them book in a prior episode resources is all about that cuesta quest to find an algorithm they can handle any situation that son or least most situations on us on an ass or if the golan heights running deep learning is these days because neural networks can handle a surprising amount of situations but for while they're a particular algorithm was used for a particular situation i think over time all of these organs became a little bit more say
in maybe one algorithm to handle multiple approaches elise within the domain and became increasingly obvious which situations were most common so for example in history you're gonna see recommend ursus and all the place amazon recommending the next book or product freedom by method for many the next movie for you to watch google recommending an ad based on your search crews clicks and other things recommend ursus obsessive very common situation another common situation something as mentioned cola market baskets
it's determining if you buy this and that what might you also by its to suggest for you and other products based on things are currently in a shopping cart so that's another common situation so we've learned over the years and industry which situations are the most common and which are runs in the pipes the situations so of the hundreds and hundreds of machine learning our rhythms out there there are a handful of insignia see most commonly and me personally what i've seen most commonly i have
boil down into this and the next episode and splitting this episode in half because it would be so long otherwise into the outer insight personally favor the most fundamental free to learn so in this episode that we're gonna talk about came nearest neighbors came means op reorient principal component announces indecision trees and the next episode work and talk about support actor machines naive days and a handful of other miscellaneous algorithms like anomaly detection
manor systems and markoff chains now understanding these basic algorithms like to settle the fundamental freer success machine and then you'll encounter so many other machine learning algorithms out there in the wild real quickly get feel for which algorithms are most common ideals also needs determined for whatever project you working on whether it's professionally your hobby which algorithm is algorithm to use for your specific projects as can be a key point is you are going to get a job machinery of the work
one person projects a machine learning there are hundreds i'm assuming our runs out there we can boil down to the most use our rhythms and so you may use the term in which our rhythm that suit you were specific projects so the end of the next episode in the show no sign of postal ain't it's basically a decision tree for deciding which are written to use for your project based on various attributes about your project and then you can dive into the details of that specific learning algorithm now as it is the nature of my pod past i'm not going
go too deep into any of these machine learning our rhythms in do very high level approach to how they work conceptually sell apologies for that only to dive into the details later on your own by way of the resources there recommends you per usual okay let's start from the top let's remember how old machine learning this haircut we'd broken down ai becomes machine learning machine learning splits into supervised unsupervised in reinforcement learning
three seven categories of machinery there is a force category called semi supervises kind of the middle of sneaky the this like three point five categories a machine learning i'm not there really talk much about some i've supervised learning but let's understand these three categories we've talked about supervise learning in the past with linear and logistic regression actually everything we've talked about it passes supervise learning new images to progression and neural network says ross supervise the old hours can be used actually for unsupervised and
reinforcements that's another reason why you know my work sir so popular is they can be applied in a space machine running supervised it's broken down into classification regression remember classification is categorizing of thing as this that area thing kept our trade and regression is coming up with a continuous a value output a number so either classification or a number so i'd think we all understand supervise learning just dandy by now supervise learning is giving your system
a spreadsheet with all the labels in place and the learns the state of parameters by looking at each row one at a time making a gas and figuring out how bad did and correcting that there are the algorithm is sort of supervising itself i mean you feed in the spreadsheet the matrix of data with the labels and models for consumes it degrades over and trains itself will think of it that we really we think of as we are supervising the training of the model
think of the latest think of it like training at dawn to sits or to do some trick and you've got your hands behind your back in one hand you have a treat and the other hand you haven't newspaper and you say sits in the dog makes a gas so you try something a stanza and you spent on the nose of the newspapers that was the terror function telling it had made a mistake so the dogs thinks it's head and try something else that tries rolling over in new spain to the newspaper is a bad job and so the dog stand
back up and i think savings and it sits and then you give it a treaty say good job so supervise learning is like supervising the training of your algorithm just like training a dog with treats or a newspaper good are bad got reinforcement learning skipping over unsupervised for now reinforcement learning is an interesting twist or not as c. reinforce the learning our rhythms until much later in the series in reverse the learning sort of the gateway to artificial intelligence it's the way by which
you exits machine learning as a professional field and enter the world of artificial intelligence proper way reinforcement learning works is you give your model de gaulle okay see you give the dog a goal to other dogs run through the woods and retrieve the pheasants that you just shot down but more than that i like to think of reinforce the learning is even deeper than that it's like putting up backpack on her dog giving him a sword and shield and saying you're gonna find treasure at the
and of your quest if you find yourself in a cave of sorrow that is that leave the cave if you find yourself amongst the blue people they're going stay with them though give you points so you give your model the system both positive and negative reinforcement and a purpose which is maybe to find the treasure the end of the maids and the learns how to navigate the system the words the rules of the game what actions it can take it's kind of coming out of that age
algorithm you stand on this journey sago now for time is of the essence and you pushed the doorway status backpack and it's sort this and he'll fight right now it doesn't know what firm right but eventually at the end of this journey it strong enough local ninety nine minutes figure everything out figured out the rules of the game how to play the game cuts are bad dog food is good and finally learns how to get to the treasure at the ends as reinforcement learn refer to my name is sending 'em all on its way giving it's some positive and negative
enforcement guidelines and over the mourns the rest of the system on its own okay so supervise and supervising reinforcements we skipped unsupervised unsupervised i think of as sort of the redheaded stepchild to everything in between unsupervised and it has a very simple definition it's that you are not surprising it's learning process whether by reinforcement roles in the case of reforms are learning nor bike free labeled d. n. a. in the case of surprise learning the algorithm is left with
own devices to figure things out and you're not telling you whether did good or bad it is saying okay all take what you gave me so for example you give a bunch of on labeled the west pretend that you have a bunch of humans tax and fish and you had them all to your unsupervised are rhythm and you say hey keep him as sort these out for me you as the human don't know let's pretend you don't know the difference between human affection of cat and the machine doesn't know either you didn't give it labels
to come with the day just give a bunch of stuff to me like you made me sit these in the three piles volume you figured out i'm sure you do just fine and so the algorithm of scratches it's channel and looks at this high all of objects skater not sword and not in three piles and needs to sift them out into three piles so does its best and it sure enough you know it's good algorithms says these things out so so all human your mom paula catherine one pile all fisher another pot at unsupervised learning because you didn't super
why is the algorithms training you learn on its own what characteristics separate things and the output doesn't come with any labels okay so supervise and to rise in reinforcement learning so okay so i think you understand supervise learning baby reinforcement learning sam lebudde mysterious interesting or not we get into that maybe unsupervised little bit fuzzy for you will you i think you'll understand a little bit more was made into an example buffers let's start with a supervise learning our rhythm k.
so again we're going to be covering many algorithms in this and the next episode just ole of the land of some of the most popular algorithms be used in the machine learning world we've already covered linear and logistic regression and neural networks three supervise learning algorithms to recover a handful of other algorithms when you're an logistically gretchen are examples of shallow learning algorithms neural networks of course are deep learning our rhythms and we're focusing on shallow an hour
and in this episode so your next shallow learning algorithm is called k. nearest neighbors katie and then came nearest neighbors is an interesting algorithm in that it doesn't learn city may be thinking okay why harry putting this in an episode about machine learning to visit our than a dozen are well it's commonly used by machine mining engineers it is commonly applied to machine learning situations imagine it
basically a brainless machine learning algorithm that's all it doesn't want it doesn't out the thing that parameters there are no theta planners in the system than the reason though we're starting with this algorithm this episode is the easiest understand in fact is the easiest machine learning our them to understand all the whole the machine learning our rooms in my opinion much more so than when you're logistic regression to this'll be a breath of fresh air came nearest neighbors how does it work imagine our example of hugh
men's cats and fiction many use an example for this episode mentioned taking a giant pile of humans cats and fish and dropping them again to the facts into an aquarium okay hands all humans are kind of position in one cloud one cluster over here and in all the fish for one cluster over here okay so we have x. y. and z. axes these are going to be features of course when you're working in space in machine
learning one deed or two d. or three the three dimensional space forty five the bestseller out the orton anshan is your features so the position of the human in this aquarium would be maybe three features here let's say their features here are a number of legs lives in the c. n. and it is a mammal so based on those three features were warned to position our camels unfair
it's locations in our queer him now are fish wall cluster around one area or humans will all cluster around another area and our tax will all cluster around another area as a very simple example with three features three dimensions in more complex examples we may be dealing with fifty features were even more having any range of numerical values whose values maybe you will be less obvious the wait hey nearest neighbors works is you drop in
you object into the aquarium claw you drop an attack an attack gravitate automatically to the cluster of cats simple as that came nearest neighbor means when you add a new objects into the vat and yet in new objects into your model it figures out which group of things it has the most in common with soul of all my neighbors which ones in my nearest to base on my features my number of legs m. imam
all enjoy live in the c. k. in cane years neighbors means the number of classes you're actually and see this all watson machine learning k. representing the number of classes think of it like saying class with a k. i don't know why it's actually k. but so what algorithm does you specify top flight how many classes are in the system in our case three we have cats humans and fish so three classes you put all your day then into place pre labeled from this
reggie sobel last column of your spreadsheet is the label whether it's cat human or fish all of them calm pre labels and so everybody's been placed in three dimensional space and then you add a new input to the system and a figures out what class or cluster that input has the most in common with based on his features who of all its neighbors is it nearest to source said this is not the learning algorithm this is what's called an instance basic or grew them too
we're works is you how full all of you were rose in memory and when you can put a new role in khumalo it compares that inputs to every single role that exists in your training did it in memory so we look over or spreadsheet every time we added a new route is slipping over every roll call a truce instances of living over every instance okay so that that's the nearest neighbor basically ally to think of it
magnets suspended in a vat is you have three clusters court kate clusters all center around a magnet can you drop the new objects into the back and stick it automatically pulled to the right magnet based on its features so that they supervise learning how rhythm the dead giveaway first whether something is unsupervised learning our rhythm is does it calm with the labels did you give that the algorithm of spreadsheet with pool labels as the last
on and indeed we did with the nearest neighbors so that's cayenne and that's a very simple supervise learning algorithm but it's going to segue s. very effectively into your first unsupervised learning algorithm call came means k. means k. again being the number of classes so first off unsupervised learning white guy said is that you have your day yet but it is not labeled in your algorithms can try to figure something out about the data
it's been and work with the dado bit but it's him or that on his own is a natural label davis nocturnal learned to protect the value or categorization is said it may we structure dale aurora nice them in some way get so three types of unsupervised learning our rooms are called clustering association and dimension ellie reduction let's start with clustering so clustering looks very similar to cain years neighbors we have the facts the aquarium
with clusters of objects k. we've got our humans are catch enough fish and it has separated from each other in space based on their features in knin we basically had magnets put into place in the middle of those clusters we had a human magnate have put the posture of the humans a fish magnet in between all the fish in a cat's magnate in vitriolic cats it doesn't really work that way under the hood thewlis be our revenue may not understand what i'm trying to get out there that kind of conceptually that
where works you kind of creating a magnet out of your cluster of objects the cat meg kincaid means you'll earning the magnets you or learning is machine learning your updating some parameters you're learning where these magnets ago now here's the thing like this said the unsupervised learning the dead giveaway is always whether or not comes with labels degas in clustering you don't have labeled day that instead you just have a high old stuff you just don't get a box
humans cats and fish into the aquarium we don't know if they're humans castor fish the machine doesn't know theory and scatter fish is stuff just a bunch of data points it's stocks that pay as far as you and i are concerned and the model in the computer is just a bunch of dots in the aquarium and what the models trying to do is figure out what or some sensible clusters of all those dots how can we partition and in a certain way it seems
that there is a senior of dots over here the sphere of dots over here and another one over there seemed like the space between now and i'm not touching each other there's not overlap or if there is overlap it still seems like this is the sphere and that's the sphere can avoid a van diagram that overlapping in the middle it's still seems to me that there's something this way the difference between this cloud in that cloud i don't know what i'm an organic call them the mongol learn the line that safir
it's none of that clustering does that sound category in unsupervised learning and k. means is one of the most popular specific algorithms you used in clustering so k. means k. means is interesting is very similar to cayenne and figures there is on an already you're probably turn figure out what could possibly be the difference the way i'm describing at the difference is that it learns were these maggots go these magnets are called central way it's central way
it's an once again you specified upfront how many you need so i have a bunch of docks and i know that i need three classes that as many specify three k. equals three you don't lawyer doc since the vats and so here's conceptually how i think of the arboretum maggi replace some sports game with a bunch of kids you drop all the kids off the field and then he dropped three team leaders on to the field randomly distraught them from the air a new lands on smithfield be free
we look around and they try to figure out who their teams are you tell them up right there are three teams and i'm pretty sure that i mean there's an answer to this equation i don't really know as a human but i'm quite sure that there's three can of real concrete teams here you've gotta figure them out to your team leaders look around and they'll scatter they weren't in some direction they running in the direction that it looks like to them is a cluster of people be separate
cluster of players and so they stopped in all players realize ok this is my team captain so the sign themselves that team captain players don't move these dots do not move in the fact that the team captains do and in the team captains all can look around again the reassess nineties samurai n. n. no doubt they'll scatter gan iran little bit closer than they do this over over over every time they do it all the team members sort of keep in their mind okay he and that's why captain that's my captain until eventually
all the team leaders have figured out what really is the natural clustering of the steeds i didn't really explain a very well i don't have a very good way of explaining this but that's how works basically you drop always examples into a back gate each have features but they don't have a label so that last coleman for spreadsheet is nonexistent the features or the dimensions those dimensions determine where in space these objects are and then
you drop three magnets into that and those magnets figure out on their own hope to position themselves such that there are in a position that separates the three clouds of dots most effectively and of course the purpose of any machine running our them does for making future productions to those magnets are now in place so that when you drop the future example into that it automatically gets assigns to the right cluster k. it mean
escaping the number of classes know you'll note if if we don't all whole bunch of d. n. a. into a back with fried natural classes of humans fish and cats and we then said that there are two classes k. equals two then it might not learned to you very affective delineation or who said kate equals four there may be sort of unnatural segregation of day that in the population that is not a parent
us nor is apparent machine in giving in the wrong number of classes mean sort of dooming the algorithm so which came means and clustering in general you sort of have to have an intuition about how many classes my kind of exists in the system is a good example the book i'm going to recommend to the end of this episode called machine learning with all our were the author or takes a bunch of both social network dana for a bunch of high school student
okay so things they might say on their facebook wall were things that they like or dislike various interests and in actually categorizes the students into five categories now as is the case in unsupervised learning it doesn't give you new labels live if you look in the way it categorizes these things you can poorly tell what is doing it has been jocks the princess's the nerds the criminals and the basket cases so these are have five
natural high school stereotypes that we kind of think of is natural our minds and it turns out the machine learning our room discovers with these is actually the case belongs you tell out that there are five stereotypes if you made it for them in my removed last stereotype of ennobled of the fuzzy won anyway the basket case the iowa bad as if you made six that might come up with the new class of people maybe that might still loops are stereotypes law that spread them thin
it can make a little bit less sense so happening in natural sort of understanding of the problems that you're working with him or fifth term in the number for classes mrs some number k. in the system is an important but there are actually algorithms they can actually learn the best k. for you there are somehow rooms out there that will help you to determine with which k. is the best for situation saw no leave it to of course as usual the ensuing corsair course to teach you the deeds
ills of k. means and clustering okay so we covered cayenne and they supervise learning algorithm for us or finding what object fits wear it with the label tree label day that makes unsupervised learning our them bands and then putting a new logic in getting a label back is also part of that supervised peace of the day unsupervised learning our them now we delve into the world of open supervise learning the seconds of the triumvirate of machine running out rhythms we broke that down into claude
strain association and dementia or the reduction and our other sub fields of unsupervised learning about clustering i think is probably what you'll end up saying the most common in the world unsupervised learning and we discussed a specific algorithm of clustering called a means very similar to pay and an okay so let's enter a new sub category of unsupervised learning called association or association rules again you don't give the machine learning model
free labeled dana so that last called spreadsheet with labels does not exist association rule learning as interesting type of machine running algorithms another name is sometimes about market basket analysis the idea of the physician role learning is you're going to learn if somebody buys this and that's what other things might they buy so this obviously has massive value in the commerce in regular commerce okay so new
sample is if you are designing a store lay out some of them by marshmallows and graham crackers or what might you also put in your of those two things obviously chocolate hershey's chocolate bars so association learning it is all about put more stuff in the customers basket it's learning wyatt's commonly goes with what other things if you have a set of some stuff baby and see what often goes with those deed be with
only have a the speed go with a select association rule learning market basket analysis now here's little bit it's interesting info about association role learning is often associated with data mining remember we're talking about davis science being broken down into various is some fields so one field day is science is the analysis and visualization charts and graphs and stuff another field as machine learning of course acts
another feel was a dimension apart so does just database science being really good at writing database queries being a mice equal or host grass expert case that's a sub field of data science and of course another sub field is science is called the mining it is mining information from the web or from some other days source case of scraping the web may be crawling the web put it into your database putting him through the day the pipeline by way of spark
or had you remember those two technology is spark and had to those are your data pipeline frame works for very large amounts of d. n. the dna call a big day that and then finally bring in all of your database and may be coming up with some sort of conclusion and that conclusion maybe by way of association role learning now says issue we're all learning is clearly machine learning we're learning to predict something based on a pattern no
recognize glad it's kind of also data mining so this is where you start to see all the sub fields of these signs were really they really are the molds together it's really tough to tell them apart sometimes a lot of overlap association role learning is clearly a machine learning type of algorithm but it's a lot times two hundred rise within the field of data mining and i think it's because the mining sort of predates machine learning as a very practical for
you'll get industry where people were using the association role earning eighty commerce really early on and so they just kind of categorize anything else machine learning that one along with the data that was super practical matter early days as simply part of the data mining process itself market basket analysis or association role learning is learning what typically goes with what other things in a very common in our revenues here is just call walked free ori the acri or
we are rhythm if you're that word means the public are for what the hell so operandi is like it comes before we're you know something already sold in philosophy if you have some proper yuri knowledge before embarking on an argument that piece of information is naturally part of the argument so offer your knowledge is that you already knew it the way our crew or works in the market basket is like so if i know that day is common
and i know that b. is common and i know the sea is common in case of marshmallows graham crackers and hershey's chocolate but i know that deed is super on common nail polish who knows how i wanna know what goes with a and b. all the natural conclusion as c. not because i know that see those within the but because i know that seed is simply a common and he is not so it's kind of using these like you you
a lot they small database of common things and then you group of those together in tunis and figure out which of those is common and an eager demont freezing figure out which of those is common they saw wrist shot things off along the way it does sort of reduced the problems that so association roller in really works with big day that most effectively and so the more that you can reduce your dated down in this process the better says the op for our room and finally won lasts
a category of unsupervised learning i'm going to mention is called dimension alley reduction to mention l. u. reduction dementia reduction is very easy to understand conceptually the idea is that if you have a lot of features many many many many many features for all of your rose in your data for your shimmering algorithms it is in your best interest to weed duke's the amount of features you have and you can do that actually you can you can remove feature
but what what dimaggio you reduction dozens dozens of bill week features it figures out what sort of combinations of features can make new features how can you boil two into wine and keep doing that over and over until you've really slims down all your features to the minimum amount of features so the best example i've heard is students g. p. a. b. g. p. a. is one feature that sort of represents howl
all the students did academically in college knows lots of features that you could consider even consider their test scores their homework assignments their attendants if you're trying to decide if you wanted to hire a student for example you could have been sent you there transcripts with all the information that he could possibly gather from the university the test scores are tenants all these things or you could just ask further g. p. a n. n. g. p. a. is basically all those things boiled
down into one number so that swept demand shelly reduction dies the menzione reduction algorithms figure route how to assess all the features that you've given it in words of boil lower was down into a smaller amount of features and one of most common algorithms years call principal components analysis and the name of the algorithm is basically an innate sense is everything i just described were figuring out all the components of the hundred compound
it's wishful you are the principal wants which of these are the most important or if all of them are important how can we boil them all down in to say five components siege features components equals features the principal component analysis and not to be given to the degree of their algorithm of course it's an intriguing corsair of course it looks a whole lot like linear regression in my mind so this is another case where knowing the fundamentals of
these basics and statistics linear regression logistic regression is that the common to play elsewhere and to machine learning so as lived by those first okay so that unsupervised learning unsupervised learning i kind of think of unsupervised learning as your miscellaneous juror that you might have in the kitchen okay you have your silverware drawer and you have your towel drawer and you have a drawer of o. bunch of stuff that doesn't really fit any work beckon it tends to be the unsupervised learning category
of machine learning they're all very useful are rhythms don't get me wrong i'm not calling i'm john they just kind of i don't see what keeps them all together it's this stuff that's not reinforcement status not supervised it's come all the rest there it's just a bunch of white utility algorithms unsupervised learning so unsupervised learning is clustering association roller rink dimension ellie reduction and full of seven mentioned k. means is a clustering our them opry henri businesses
the issue we're all learning our rhythm and principal component analysis or p. c. a. is a dimension audi reduction algorithm your lobbies from injuring course and for the final algorithm of this episode we're going to talk about decision trees decision trees are a very very important algorithms you know very important as i mentioned previously machine learning engineer's who've been in space for very long time are extremely skeptical and korea
all of deep learning they think that people are jumping a shark with steep learning taking it too far using is a silver bullet word should be uses a silver bullet a lot of times its decision trees but they'll use as an example of something that performs just as well though say see decision trees which of them round blocked since the fifties work just as well as your neural now works why say work just as well i'm talking about accuracy performance things over and talk about a future episode about performance evaluation
all those things but what's special about decision trees something that decision trees can do that deep learning can not do is explain it to the viewer what was learned was learned okay so when you use a decision shreve model for erna your date at the result is something you can read it's on your computer visually you can read the steps taken to come up with the decision so that's a mix decision trees particularly special
we're also very high performance there'd be worked very effectively to what is the decision tree decision tree is exactly what sounds like it's just like when you come up with the decision tree in real life you say okay if my mom rights of free then maybe you'll go out and do this but if she writes of five will cokie okay if she's not hungry then will go drinks first but she is hungry then we've got three restaurants to choose from it's raining or none of this russia will walk so basically it's a whole
what ship bethel statements the hare propulsion sure no recall one decision trees but they are to draw them from the top so imagine if you will be circled the top that branches downward left and right into two circles and each of those branch downward left and right into two circles now the decision tree learning our rubin will learn these these nodes and their branches it will learn what things to check first and what things the checks
and what things to check third cetera it will learn what was the very top white is the first thing that i should try or talking about our fish humans and cats scenario what is the first thing you can check to rule out the majority of the remember we have three features number of ways is a mammal and lives in the sea well humans in cassar mammals supper with no checked his mammal that we would have to break that down even
or based on the number of legs for example but we first chaps number of legs or lives in the sea either of those features would tell us right away that it's either a fish or something else and then if it's something else we could break down by a member of legs so the top note of our decision tree of oral learned that decision tree would be lives in the sea question mark if yes it's a fish
if no then you go down new branch and in that pledge asks the question number of legs if to that the human it for them it's a cat so that's a decision tree very simple our model will earn the optimal placement of questions and number of branches in history and then like this said before the nice part is when it's done it will presents t. u. v. show we a tree
and you can actually look at it and read it as the engineer which is not something you do with almost any other our room under the sun so if a customer comes in to u. n. you have a linear regression logistic regression learning our rhythm that is meant to learn whether or not somebody should be eligible for a bank loan okay you're a banker a financier and customer comes and asks can i please have a bank loan they thought an application dollar questions of the application or the features
they go into learning model things like have you ever de false alone have you ever been bankrupt which are age would you do professionally etc will to fight them into logistic regression or neural network dental spit out the answer now all ineligible for bank loan and go through around in your soul which ariel say i'm sorry sir you were knowledgeable for the bank loan mostly whites why in your turn around you look in your computer will be a whole bunch of green ones and zeroes trickling down the black screen like the major
stay and you're like love me turn off your monitor charger customers say i i don't know but you are knowledgeable in the storm out a paragraph you cannot visually interprets most machine learning algorithm suggest they're just numbers but if it was a decision tree the customer economists say can i have a bank loan an eap type in the application pungent your decision tree algorithm and it spits out a visual sri for you to you take a finger you pointed that hopman cup killed
c. so said known you'd go down to the right at last the good of the ride is o'clock this is where you failed sir it's because you've defaulted on previous long i'm so sorry this is all candor stanley walks out it just so happens that in the financial industry you are required to tell your customers why american eligible for a bank or so in this particular case that i used a decision tree is legally required so for many applications in
shimon indecision trees are very good beer redouble their obviously very easy to implement by way of any sort of machine learning library out there like psychic learn or any of our packages you can actually use decision trees not only for classification like i'd just use miss example but also for regression for actual numerical outlets floats have to explain but you call a classifying decision tree a classification tree and a numerical output tree you call the regressions
the natural now all the algorithms i'm not going to explain how they work the actual earning our rhythms the process of learning the tree is figuring out what questions to ask first second third and so on the call for them for learning those things calm there is one by the name of that i eighty three one is c. forgot five another is c. five thou go and others court case of a goddess funky names don't think you really need to understand how layout rooms work even when you're
learning machine learning detectives had them in with your machine learning libraries are packages in our psychic learn whatever using and thrown a buzzword set us on what prepare you for your received when you're learning the details so that you're not overwhelmed with a bunch of towards the sea in the wild k. when you start to explore the world machine learning you see millions and millions of words or just tell you what they are even without getting into the details just a you know come wearer thing falls into place along those loy
and there's two kind of popular spins off of decision tree is the vanilla decision tree is just like i described to you it has a problem with the cold over fading which is something ari get into a few drops are over fitting in the way you alleviate this problem is by way of making many many many many trees what's called a forest were you when i'm forrest sometimes you figure route of the average best amongst the
trees so who did that's w. w. trees who are the best trees amongst you and figure out what they all have in common in order to construct the ultimate sri case that's our way and i'm forrest approach make a bunch of trees boiled down to one and something very similar is called agree in boosting so i know but i don't really understand how brave boosting works at the gate hot off the tree is certain points at an early stage in the trees developments
then they can and do the same thing as rain forests don't call me on at the base that's wanted a heads-up you to those two words you're gonna see you when i'm forrest ingredient boosting very commonly thrown round all over the internet to basically optimization spawn decision trees okay how about that whirlwind to work this is only part one of a two part series on all holtz were always algorithms park who is going to cover support vector machines
naive days anomaly detection recommend ursa stems and markoff chains and again this may seem very overwhelming i just want to give you a lay of the land of many of the popular mushy learning our runs out there there's hundreds and hundreds of machine learning algorithms every power than can be applied to a different setting we're getting closer to the master algorithm potentially by way of deep learning and neural networks but it is in your message
stuart least have an appreciation and understanding of the most popular show learning algorithms so that you can both save time and money what comes to competition or resources and for situations for which neural networks are not suited at present and there are many such situations are many situations where shall learning algorithms or your best that's what i mean by that is we're talking apples to oranges it's not a performance comparison is just something in your mouth works may or may not be able to handle so
is it your interest to get at least a lay of the land of the shallow learning our rhythms and i would recommend trying to understand the details of them offline by way of the resources so let's talk about the resources on what the post an article called a tour of machine learning our rhythms that basically just like this episode on the spy machine running master dot com which is a website that i've recommended before he puts out very good stuff very very similar to this pot casbah in artful format will be a visual representation of ever
hey man i'm discussing in this episode so do something to visually latch onto says i know the audio congealed it too much there is an image online put out by psychic learn to remember sai kit learned is the python library of shallow learning algorithms basically everything that you're in here about in this and the next episode are gonna be things you can use by way of psychic learned these are not our rooms that are present in texture flow to answer flow is built primarily for deep
aren't you can build your own shallow learning our rhythms and cancer flows if you understand how the algorithms work you just use the low-level tends to flow math wipers by one recommended i'd recommend sticking to sai kit learn for showing our rhythms and then moving on to tester flow for the deep learning algorithms so psyched to learn put out an image that is a decision sri for which algorithm to use where how bout that decision trees very mad at so if this is
tree for deciding which algorithm of opal world of machine learning our rhythms you she used given your predicament okay them are working with tax to pay go this way how many training samples to have to go that way very very handy so look at that look of that before we get the next episode cousin accept sorghum do couple more on rooms and then i'm i'm busy lives in a cop in case the resources section in the next episode is the same resources battered be useful for the next episode the next resource on
when recommend it is called machine learning with our this is a tyler recommendation most of my recommendations are sort of averages for round here nothing's they see people reckoning olver and over and over can of the de facto resources this is a resource probably slipped out somewhere so summary recommended some work but i've never seen recommended otherwise and i a pool of this book machine learning with bart is a fantastic explanation of the machine in concepts in a way that i thought was
i think sometimes in other courses or books to read as a very good job thoroughly explaining the details machine in concept additional eight he commerce lot of algorithms that intervened does not cover all which are essential so for example naive day's market basket analysis in our pre henri sensation roland and kane years neighbors in gaza cars decision trees which is not covered by intervening decision trees are on the things that you're gonna see in almost any other machine learning resource you read so dole
to teach you are all long way which python is the main line was ignored be using your mission on the jury ally said in a prior episode that are in java are two very strong ron rocks that might be handy having your tool belt okay now i'm going to mention to text books they're very heavy and they're very commonly recommended they're there to help understand how machine learning works at a fundamental level in the copper lot of these algorithms that that a mention in the sun
accepts and remember my analogy of the machine learning process to cooking i said that when around rose kind of like talking things out and statistics is your cookbook your recipe book and and put on a gavin is calculus best learning process while most of the resources that i've been giving you up to this point are basically cookbooks light up a list of recipes to use your machine learning endeavors these textbooks and one recommends you are for lowering the theory of food
it's basically a learning why in the recipes or what they are if you have some understanding of statistics how can you blew a bunch of concepts together in order to form a machine learning recipe and be so these textbooks on what is called elements of statistical learning and another is called pattern recognition and machine learning so i recommend these textbooks eventually you should eventually read these textbooks they're very very commonly were
demanded an essential for you to have a thorough understanding of how machine learning works at a fundamental level i don't think i would necessarily recommend them yet now i try to tie my resource recommendations to the top at the episode topic even if you're not necessarily ready for those resources at that point in time so these are kind of these attacks bookseller recommend you come back to when you really wanna have a more thorough understand
how how machine and works of fundamental level and it will cover a lot these machine in our rooms i've mentioned but don't go even deeper though the help you understand not just what algorithms to use honor which circumstances and why but how do we even come to that conclusion how did we come up with the new machine learning our rhythm for the situation that we come up with these recipes learn how to invent recipes to the knock confounded by the recipe books is not
just members nation so again these are books though recommend you we turn to in the future once you have a more solid understanding and foundation in machine learning elements of statistical earning and pattern recognition and mushy learning to text books okay that's it for this episode i'll see you in part two


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash and l. g. had time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called black mayors like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode thirteen shallow learning algorithms park to support factor machines and naive
aids in this episode and be talking about support back to machines and naive days class of fire these are two very powerful machine learning techniques scholl learning algorithms these are kind of those power machine learning our rhythms power tools i consider a decision trees support factor machines and naive basic consider them all three to be sort of power tools lot of the other shallow learning our rooms and you'll learn were sort of dedicated to particular tasks or even if they're more like purpose they shine under specific
circumstances but decision trees support vector machines a naive bays are sort of these particles would be quiet across a very wide with spectrum of machine learning applications they're primarily bill for classification all three of these are rhythms are primarily bill for classification that can be used for regression before reaching far this episode are wanna talk about the fact that we're talking now so many machine learning algorithms morris up so i dropped a bombshell on you missteps already talked about two more in the next episode and actually decided to stretch bitch
you pour into a three part or the next episode and excited and even maureen shimmering our rhythms that so many machinery our rooms haris was aside what use when welders amoral type heart approach to deciding which machine learning algorithm to use giving of circumstances which talk to the passes sort of deep learning can be seen as the silver bowl they can be used across a wide spectrum of a machine learning problems right now are taking a diversion were caught in a shallow learning our rhythms that was selling showering our rooms at the nose
secondly which algorithms are supposed to be used and which circumstances described as small plates your approach to deciding which algorithm to use on reassurances that hot global cern machine learning our rhythms only handle specific tasks so it for example the next episode on a talk about an anomaly detection algorithm well you only use one or a handful of algorithms for not only detection you don't use things like linear regression or logistic regression or maybe our rooms are really talking on this set
so and so there is a level of domain knowledge that will filter down the types of algorithms that you can be using freer specific purposes it's apples to oranges this situation only calls for a handful of machine learning our rooms that can be applied whatsoever and i just takes familiarity with one machine learning our rooms and whether specifically built for i think listening to this broadcast series and taking a changing course and some other follow-up material wheels
did you feel for what algorithms are built for what purposes but there we go down all level we decided to work and be working in supervise learning classification and so that only includes a handful specific algorithms we excluded all hold on to our rhythms like all unsupervised learning our rhythms any regression algorithms us r. use linear pressure for this robberies k. means we're going to go classification but now we have a whole bunch of classification our rooms to work with some wasn't so it's not my decision treason is up senator gossip
vector machines and naive days all of these are classify robin's wilson of logistic regression we have neural networks how the heck am i going to choose from angst always class of fires will this point will want people machine into tuesday look at their degas and a look at their environment of system computer how much ram does it have and how flexible are we with high in the store is running our rooms making the inferences and productions certain algorithms work better with certain types of d. n. the baby logistic regression worked really well with
numerical input is also very sensitive to missing features such like this naive days works better with categorical input is not sensitive at all to missing dana naive days class of fires are very fast ryan in very memory efficient the middle of it less precise than something like a neural network and yeoman work takes a lot longer to run and train was very precise in king represent very complex malls so once we know what category of machine learning algorithms we're gonna be using force
the purposes then we considered the situation in hand memory restrictions time restrictions what is our data look like how many samples do we have certain machine lowering our rooms were really well with only a handful samples wall of the machine learning algorithms require townsend's kinds of examples your training dss neural networks for example are vexed by the fact that they need lots and lots and lots of data were isn't naive baze crossfire for example doesn't need that much
they get to get up and running so you look at your data to plot a chart graf it you decide if you're missing any information is a numerical is accounted for cole polish memory by hello my machine works time don't have to work with how many examples the white house and then you decide so that parcel little bit hottest have to explain and high caste format envoy to link in the resources section to the table of pros and cons for specific algorithms given situations like memory constrains time constraints is sarah there's also it
susan sri put out by sight yet learned a python library for scholl earning machine running out rhythms they have a decision sri up a picture like a flow chart for helping you decide which are written to use given the circumstances so i asked you some yes no question it's things like why have greater than fifty thousand examples in my training dana yes go this way if not go that way okay is this text based go this way my missing a gate ago that way and it'll help narrow down when the shimmering algorithm you're supposed to use ended up on the reason i mix
when all is that is skin seemed so overwhelming at first lady's role million she learning your rhythms that you anything i have all these organs how restless know what used when and where under the system is assistance deciding what to use in the final approach finally once we've decided that a handful of our rooms and we can use given the circumstances is actually just try them all the losses seal on the machine boeing engineers will do is built import from sight yet learned portents are flow just all the algorithms that can possibly be applied to their circumstance though
clean up the data will visualize the date of abuse and stuff with training they have both split into training donations has settled into that stuff in another episode bananas grow all are gay death room ten machine learning our rooms rome all parallel or cereal whatever and in the very end the file you'll see bill evaluate the performance of all the machinery now runs all the rights and code that determines how well he childbirth and did it compare them all to reach other and find a champion or champions for when the losers in may
keep the top three on hand as a continuing their programming eventually will sort come to a conclusion that one is clearly the winner this is the right now with a job or her role with that does not necessarily very clear what our room to use when it's like a three part approach we start the top where we decide what algorithms reason grossly applicable okay as supervisor or unsupervised learning situation why have the labels okay sit supervises it regression or classic
asian opiates classification now we have maybe two thirty algorithms that we can choose from bullets plot ortega let's look at the situation was look good environment work of constraints are we up against it at this point slow the difficult to memorize which our rooms work best given constraints and degas we usually do then is you look at this reference table or that psychic learned flow chart to help you pick a handful algorithms to try and they just throw them all against the wall you just shotgun approach all the zagreb
it's an evaluation metric the end of your script will tell you which one did best singular lot machine learning algorithms and use this approach to determine which aren't you getting a circumstance with that out of the way let's jump into the first of these to our rooms called support vector machines s. b. m. is a very we're we're i'll tell you why it's called an a bit less just try to understand intuition what does so like i said these these power tool machine lowering our rhythms like this is
sri support actor machines and naive days they can all use for both classification and regression so they're supervise learning shimmering our rhythms it can be used bowl for classification and regression also neural networks can be used for class issue regressions well you'll find that the primary use case of all of these are rhythms is classification animals this is true or not but it seems to me from my experience that classification is kind of the majority use case of machine learning that you'll see
in the wild hello this is true don't call me on that but you'll see that these machine running our loses power tools are paralegal for prosecution can be used for aggression because their primary use case is classification you'll see it the examples or the tutorials will all be showing you how to use them for classification and i thought i will be doing this episode and then you can know how to look at how to use them for regression on your own so support factor machines can be used for classification and regression when you use a support beckerman
gene for classification it's called a support vector classify your best b. c. and if you use it for aggression is calling support vector regrets are asked the war and bill broad category of these is called support vector machines so we're gonna go with the classification examples like i mentioned how works is it's determines a decision boundary decision mounted between your things over here in your things over there that sounds a lot like logistic regression is very similar to logistically correction
but gus and it's got some kirk's over logistic regression obituary minute but let's remember what a decision boundaries listed ahab all attacks on the left an old dogs on the right you graf of cats and dogs they're just dots on the graph right but imagine blue dots and red dots these are your date appointees are you training examples we have all the cattle ethanol dogs on the right we want to do is come of all lying in draw line in the stands between the katzman dogs so no dogs allowed over your left say the cats
so that line the separates you katherine dogs court decision boundary and now if you hadn't you can award to the next based on some features about the animal weather has whiskers doesn't bark how many lives does it have etc peas role of features will be used to determine where location only the object it's placed in three d. or forty space and if it's on the right side of the lying then it's a dog benefits on the left side of the wind and the cat that's your decision boundary and that looks a lot like him
logistic regression situation know what makes a supporter crushing differed from logistic regression in categorizing things over here over there he is this decision boundary specifically they support vector machine destinies align it doesn't drop in here finn lying between the two sets like logistic russian guys instead it tries to make that lying as fast as it possibly can it makes all wall doesn't use a one point why in the use
is the sixteen points brush stroke how fact is this wall well the borders on the wall on top against the innermost cats and dogs so the right most edge of this decision boundary is gonna bump up against the left most dogs and you'll left most edge of the decision boundary wall bump up against the right most cats okay so that makes sense is that you just heard phil river or make a wall
between the two things these over here in those over there as white as you can before you catch them to do that with your training set of examples know why we do that why was logistic russian insufficient what was an hour winds official why do we know that line of the reason is because of a of a problem that we're beginning to if you trapped so called over fifteen overfishing is basically if i were to draw the line between cats and dogs i could try wrong actual
let's say that i had a cat's closer to the middle wolf i wasn't smart i might draw the line to accommodate backpack skolnick outlier something that doesn't really fit the bill of the majority of the day that i might skew the lying maybe i'll tell blind counterclockwise or clockwise little bit to accommodate for that one out lying packed in other words i didn't make the most ideal line possible you and me
we're humans we look in a cluster of doctor weir cluster bombs over there and in our minds we can drop of vertical line way down the center even if there is an outlying die we still have an intuition where that wine goes where's the best line that separates the two classes of that in the future fire at a new objects into the mix or go on the correct side logistic regression little bit sensitive to our wires and things like this in the skin cause aligned against him properly drawn and is
is called over fitting in extreme example of overseeing the magill line that goes right out of her cool and then it like squiggles outs like half circle to include that i'll wind happening keeps going imagine adweek created some wild function of paula no meals that allowed for that little squiggle out of the wild example overstating but in our particular situation where we're using logistic regression which is away your function will make him work with all i'm not porno mill
function i just tilting the line maybe counterclockwise or clockwise might cause some overfishing soul wide support vector machines do different than logistic regression in the case of coming up with a decision boundary between the cars on the left in the class on the right is it makes that decision boundary as fast as possible so that we can deal with these al wires no problem now the thickness of our line it's called a margin we want this fat
the line as possible we call this a larger margin classify are large margin seth ward for the thickness of alliance margin and in the word for the dots that are being bombed out against by this wine that we're trying to call support vectors that's why this thing is called a support vector machine support vectors it's gonna we're we're know why we'll call this i think we should call this algorithm bill but fat why in our rhythm and we should call
these dots that death that wine bumps up against we should call them bumping dots but no we call the algorithm of support that the machine or large margin crossfire and that these dots the dots that wine bump up against this they're called support vectors a vectors so it dawned on the u. clean graf that's why a player was what we're looking at is a bunch of doctor mcgrath you can think of them is a dot org point or you can think of them as an arrow pointing from the porch in two
that got you can be you can graft that arrow with functioned mathematically seeking represent these docks in another way and we call it a vector the vector is the line that points from the origin to be got that's why they're called support vectors there the factors that support drawing off that line okay all finding good sport actor machines seemed pretty simple looks like logistic regression with a foul wine and so skinny linus the only difference for
a well it's got one more little twist and this is where things start to get wild really we are if you ask me support vector machines only handle linear classification so does logistic regression bacon for some porno mills into the function in a situation nonlinear the battle of the less than ideal typically we typically if our situation is not only a year we move away from the when your class of fires into something more complex like a neural network for example so bold logistic regression
support vector machines are all in your class fires but here's the trick at schreck they can transform a a support vector machine into a non linear class afire in this truck is called the colonel's trick colonel katie bar any e. l. you'll see colonel's views quite commonly machine learning to vary we're dead they're very hard to understand i still haven't quite wrapped my head around them what i think it was a colonel
it's hello ports you into another dimension or this rose colored goggles that you put on an eight change the way everything looks case as a very strange to me give you an example the example who used from the um she learning with our book that all post inner resources section is that if you're looking at a graph of dots summer blue is some red okay this is what looks like you have updates blue circle of dots in the center and surrounding that is a
red circle of dots it's like a blue circle with a red border patrol dots k. it's not drawn on to the graphs to bunch of dots all that is clearly the nonlinear situation this isn't a bunch of cattle laughed and dogs on the right which is lee nearly etc bull by our decision boundary no this is a circle and a circle those are not separate all by lions however if those dots represented something can such
all week for example if we were looking at latitude and longitude and those dots represented say snow on peaks of mountains versus non snow latitude and longitude well that would really make sense as a way of looking at this would it we really care about is altitude how high up the mountain keep his hands latitude how far north and south we are those of the two characteristics that are more important rather than lou
longitude longitude doesn't help us all sofa we think about the problem different we get actually transform our situation into the new graf where dots or indeed lee nearly severed all all blue dot suddenly have become sort of rectangle on the left or right or top or bottom some sort of situation where we can actually jaw line between a bit shoe classes of dots okay so that's little bit we're let me think of another way of representing us
if you have two circles blue and red dots maybe you can think of them instead of any u. clay in space of exim why you can think of them in radiant way so this is what colonel dies of colonel what does it takes your degas this after looking at right now which is non linear league soccer ball and a transforms it into a new set of dimensions so you're looking at the latitude and longitude representation
of mountains in the world and we're trying to decide whether or not to have snow on the peaks in your scratching your chin eli collagen separate despite grab your hand might not come order come over here and hold your ground so you're looking at it from a different angle in baja okay look here from this angle things seem all that different so i'm colonel is just something that you multiply it your day nobody in or to transform it into a new dimension so i think of it is
this looking at the problem from a different angle i think it is like in the cell that all linked to the past i can refer you blow you blow on a fluke or you do samir trick and you move honey are now on the dark world to the jury get him home mahogany that you're in the white world you're the same place the whole world is really the same place everything is the same but you'll looking at different than it helps you to salt different hostels so you can transform of the circle world into
all lying world is old ones of criminals out there there's like regular basis function colonel pollen no mule colonel signori colonel to this whole bunch of colonels a whole bunch of of collared goggles that you can put on imagine a drawer full of collared goggles that you could put on a time but you have to know little about your situation get to know whether the date of the you're dealing with is sort of could be transformed into a different world so that it's easier to war
with so that is now linear least operable sell support vector machines very strange machine learning over the mind i really i need to be allowed to wrap my head around and i still don't know exactly when it's preferred t. be used under certain circumstances are not celeste listed for the top or more time with reference prior our rooms that we've used remember linear regression is a u. we gretchen algorithm for coming up with a number i'll put it okay if we want to classify something in the past we take linear regression into a
new function call logistic regression logistic regression is like using linear regression to classify things that cat or dog is ago on the left of the line or the right of the line not essentially logistic regression draws the line down the middle we call this the decision boundary this line that separates the cats from the dogs now with logistic regression unfortunately this line of maybe prone to overfishing based on i'll wire is there's a lot of day
yeah it's bad bad day that were just norway's or anything like this it could come escrow car line in my tool to its tilted down and counterclockwise or clockwise may not be the best fits that ideal loin street young center separating the katzman dogs cell we have this new algorithm for classifying things callie support vector machine and it uses a decision boundary is well that makes that decision boundary as fast as
of sulking larger margin it bumps up against the innermost thoughts on the left and right classes we call those innermost thoughts support vectors and that large margin helps us prevent overfishing future examples that step one of support vector machine is simply maybe a little bit more accurate little bit more efficient version of logistic regression you might consider it step two is this strange trip to the trade called the colonel
track at colonel trick lets you take your date at which maybe it represented nonlinear lead if you look at it like this transform its by putting on some goggles into a new dimension and now suddenly it is linear so you take a nonlinear dataset look at a different way and now it's linear we separate will also support actor machine it is a class of fire or can be used for aggression and it has the ability to represent non
when your circumstances the problem is like i said you have is this drawer of colonels goggles that help you look at situations from different angles was only so many of these is the alike circle world war real basis world is only so many ways to represent a nonlinear dataset you know linear fashion and you have to know which one to use it given the circumstances on like a neural network which is able to represent nonlinear situations completely on it so
on it will learn of the way to represent them nonlinear lady can represent any number of complex situations so support back to machines and neural networks are often compared to each other because herbal teas black box methods and they tumbled handle monitor situations the difference is that a neural network indeed learning is more powerful it can represent more nonlinear circumstances and you as the developer don't have to know in
that way is this situation nonlinear the neural network will learned that mapping for you where is the support vector machine you have to know sort of in what way does this circumstance nonlinear you don't necessarily have to know in advance you can just try throwing at all the colonel's in your drawer but you don't have that sort of upfront information that might be better to use on yeoman work anyway so why wouldn't you use a neural network well if you're sick joyce
you can be handled with a linear support back to machine okay vanilla support that the machine or you do know about the situation any can pop in what was colonels in two years we're back to machine then support after machines are all walk faster than neural networks there faster and they take up last memory and in fact you're gonna see that this is a very common recurring theme in machine learning like this said previously machine mining engineers they look at people who use steep learning as a silver bullet for
every situation they say you could do this faster with a dedicated shall learning algorithm for specific situations that call for the show learning our becomes so if your situation supports using his support actor machine then you'll be a lot worse speed and memory savings using it that's over a neural network will have to know little bit about your data said henri circumstances in advance to help you determine whether using support back to machine is for you or not so i kind of like to think
of the shimmering algorithms is you have this backpack whitman role playing game you have this backpack of tools you can use you have a grappling hook for certain circumstances you have your sword and shield yellow magic wands and so if you are presented with a puzzle okay so you need to kill a bad guy you'll use the sword and shield he needs you opened the entrance to a cave use the bomb well the neural networks and deep learning that come with a bazooka beetle sold any situation with the bazooka
but maybe it's overkill and expensive and can cause collateral damage so kill baghdad bazooka or treasure chest bazooka over cave entrance bazooka but why not use that sheep bombing case of the cave entrance when i just use your hands and see what comes over you treasure chest the way i think of support vector machines is like a gun and apollo soyuz space guy with a plastic reagan is coming for me and told it has to know when you use this bank and you try to figure out what's the best
over opening the door that's locked you can use a key you can use the bomb you can use your dues you got worried uses we're plastic reagan and a proper approach is to try at all of them try all of them and evaluate the performance of all of them at the end of your scripts determine which he did the best which took the least amount of memory the least amount of time was the most accurate model etc edges so happens that it turns out at sea in this particular case open the door the best logistic regret
and handled situation a the best by our state of support activities is we're reagan you cornet good door you shoot away sir comes out and nothing happens and how to turn around and some reba jaime soldier not using the regular basis colonels course that's why it's an open to his youthful module and you look at is the real basis connell buick guide you put it into your reagan and you should put it the word and you shoot an outcome the sonar circles woo woo woo the door opens any such
seeing that it was obvious now that wasn't support vector machines now let's move on to naive that baze class of fires naive at baze the scenic inference is a very interesting and important component of machine running in general that's the scene and friends really is a wrong that the latter of statistics like metal your previous sepsis statistics is the god mouth of machine running statistics is everything in machine learning there
basic principles of statistics with probability joy probability conditional probabilities cetera are used everywhere in machine running even if you don't know what many of the machine running our burdens that we've been discussing so far there are algorithms that come straight out of the statistics textbook we're logistic regression that statistics statistics is really essentially boil down into probability probability an inference that inference is based off of
probability and probability is sort of raul statistics so that our burdens that we've been learning so far are probability and ross is to six deep down inside the down under the hood they're just statistics but at the high level way we've been looking at them because look like machine learning our rooms accountable quite computer our rooms are complex mathematical equations yes they are they are indeed but there are truly fundamentally based on probability
now on aka teach you statistics in this high caste and i'm not a teacher probability but i am going to really quickly when you threw the basics of probability here in order help you understand how naive base crossfire's work because to understand how basie an inference that is naive days crossfire's how they worked you have to understand very basics of statistics like it said all the opposite we've been using thus far they use the test
the use them under the hood these them conceptually in principle will be easy an inference which is a class of fire supervise learning our room but also can be used for regression the scene inference is like raw statistics it's like using statistics in the wrong to handle machine learning circumstances statistics in the rock so be seen inference is really just broad true pure statistics in order to make an inference for estimate
about whether something is classified is this that or the other thing so let's try to understand probability a little bit probability probability is very simple it's the chances of something the likelihood of something of an event we call it an event what is the probability of getting it heads for a flip a coin well fifty percent fifty percent fifty fifty right it's one half the time it is heads and one half the time to just hales
so the probability of this event of flipping a coin is fifty percent okay so that's that one basic probability step two joints probability why are the chances of me getting eggheads first that flipping a coin again that banging heads up again with the chances what's the probability of a hand to be well it is simply the probability of a
winds the probability of the fifty percent times fifty percent that is points twenty five to the probability of heads and then heads again is the multiplication of the two witches points to five that is called the joint probability the probability of these things do we'd set to join the probability step three conditional probability and now we get into right proper statistics the good stuff the meat can
additional probability what is the probability that my second foot disney heads the f. the first flip was heads bombed that that's an interesting question that i don't see how the first flood has anything to the seventh what exactly as i flip a coin once heads tails with a fifty percent i flipped the coin again and get heads or tails that second foot has nothing to do
with the first foot the results of the first flip does not affect the results of the second flat those are what's called conditionally indeed pendant events independent because they do not depend on each other they do not affect each other independent events well there are some situations out there which are not in the pendant they are deep pendant so for example what is the likelihood of it's raining did
a given is cloudy outside ah now there is an interesting question is this cloudy outside then is let's say forty percent likely to rein in the probability of it raining depends on the probability of it being cloudy we call these conditionally de pendant events and is all called conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability
isn't it interesting thing is very useful and widely applicable machine learning as a mathematical formula okay probability rockabilly step one was just probability joins probability steps u. is probably times probability just multiply to conditional probability step three is this mathematical equation the probability of being given a bad is the possibility of rain given that it is cloudy outside
is the probability is a and b. the joint probability eight times be all over the probability of a okay so the probability that it is rainy given that this cloudy is equal to the probability that is rainy and cloudy over the probability that it is cloudy very strange very strange this seems kind of non intuitive amenable for some of mathematical formal
a little bit taft is 'cause he's won everything is in this puzzle was toppled the more papa called believes general probability the matter we have a big giant circle that represents whether it inside that circle or a bunch of little circles we have cloudy we have seventy we have rainy these are built based on observations on the past the number of times that the day's rainy is the number of times that we've seen it wayne last five years for example over
or the total amount of times we've seen whether at all okay so the way that we build up probabilities away we go look like we're the chances of getting cloudy at all this is that we look today's day after day after day and how the number of cloudy days and we divide that by tour lumber days with observed so let them make sense don't don't over think that it's been a rough times we've observed something over the total number of observations that cloudy days we have rabies we're sunny days now the joints probability of two events is
the number of times the overlap there is in the case of non independent events that are times over lots of an item we have cloudy days in rainy days in sunny days but say that it's cloudy forty percent of time and it's rainy thirty percent time the little sliver of overlap between jackson and little sliver very large chunk of the time they kind of ball fall move same day we have both a cloudy and a rainy day the same time that this joint probability that states cranes be george probability the number
the amount of overlap between the two weeks of the nine gramm and then conditional probability is a very interesting formula is very non into it doesn't make a whole lot says wartime visualize this as a bunch of circles and then diagrams begin to show probable you'd remember the question that we're asking is what are the chances that it's going to rain today if i know this cloudy today and formula says that the answer is the joint probability the amount of overlap between the two
and the number of times it rains and is clouding over the probability of being cloudy at all so the probability of a and b. over the probability of a soviet we have thirty three steps so far we have basic probability and we build that just by observing things over time they quince looks familiar times new ability to base of the fifty fifty we have joint probability which is the probability of two things
cole occurring and and we have come to shun all probability and that is the probability of something if we know something else and that my friends sounds a lot like fundamental machine learning right was the probability that raining given the biggest cloudy well it is cloudy days of feature a feature in our spreadsheet x. x. one and we're trying to determine is why whether or not it will rain today that looks a lot like glue
just aggression earlier aggression or any other algorithm the basic fundamental machine running out and we see this kind of the skeleton form of machine running so conditional probability is really cool war machine learning science carnival lot statistical formulation of the machine learning algorithm dish in all probability now the next and final step is called baze theorem days the day why indeed that's that is the namesake
for our algorithm here called a naive baze class of fire door the man long time ago named reverend thomas baze who's a statistician any learn a little trick of the trade when it comes to conditional probability of specifically if you know the other thing then the thing you want to know you can do a little river see on our conditional probability formula that's it that's always fear and it is it is using some statistics
you brought some public algebra and flipping staff to the other side the equation so if what we want to know is is it's cloudy and we do know that it is way meeks of the opposite the opposite of what what we're asking for well they're not the same thing very obviously they're not the same thing how likely is it for wayne if i know that it is cloudy well it is very likely to rain okay maybe less a forty percent maybe not that likely to forty percent for a fifty percent white
tour way that if it is cloudy outside well how likely is it to be cloudy this is raining all old whole really differ number now we're talkin' like many ninety five percent have you seen rained on a sunny day yes so i on a blue moon is substantially more likely to be cloudy if it is raining then it is to be raining if it's cloudy so conditional probabilities don't reverse been on the same thing that they're reversible there is a way to weave
first of them and that's called these theorem and base their looks like this the probability of a given be the case so i want to know the opposite we're equals the probability of being given eight times the probability is a tough all over the probability of the what the heck i'm not in explain where this comes from you'd have to learn based here in an era where all this and statistic say wait a spirit is a very fundamental component of statistics proper
you'll learn base there in one of us earlier chapters of your statistics textbook or the comic had recourse does not specific to machine learning it's a very wrong final court component of statistics in general and all it does is it gives you the ability to ask the question of the other way around so why is it so fundamental that sounds like step three was so without our regular probably set one joint probably step to the joint depends on where the no
look i believe an conditional probability wishes step three that depends on a two and one so they they all what you learned in sequence 'cause they depend on each other thing that conditional probability is the crux of what we need to use statistics in the rock salt probable a stick machine learning situations yes that's true but very often the question isn't passed the way you wanted it to be asked the question is the other way around so
obeys the urine is using a conditional probability and you're reverse see on the equation so you can ask the right question okay so little of the crazy let's talk about an example using e-mail spam this weather and spam are the two most commonly used examples in understanding the scene and friends and in fact weather and span classification are two of the most common applications of naive days in the wild at least up until now and to recent times
when i think deep learning principles or use little bit more commonly in the space is naive days was the champion of whether production and spam classification for e-mails the way worse for e-mails is you break that your e-mails into all of the words of an e-mail was it we build up a dictionary of english words only for while all buried downwards and basic were cited by izzy and police stop words they are of course important in grammar and understanding sentences but they may not be as import
in just classifying e-mail us spam to withdraw the stop words and we keep the essential words we start to learn that that's certain words are commonly call occurring with stan e-mails versus non spam e-mail so for example the word viag rock is very often seen in spain and e-mails unless i get ahead of ourselves first off what we wanna do is just build up a database of cop hominid every word is again in the me
nail in general and how calm in that span is in general to wiggle out a day probability of the word niagara we don't look at probability were friend saturday's weekend every word and it's on ended a probability although whether or not and e-mail us spam with say it's highlights it's like sixty percent you know spam blessed that okay so we have a bunch of probabilities that step one real role probabilities step to risk it
because we used joy pyle believe in the equation of conditional probability we'll release it to rest the exocet three is conditional probability if i've got all these probabilities words and spam what is the probability of an e-mail that i'm looking at right now all being spans to straight out okay what sixty percent with marty said that all what's the probability of that e-mail being spam given it has the following words because it does in this circumstance
it has the following words by agra free act now etc okay well we will use the conditional probability formula it'll give us a number of us the probability of the thing being spam and we have to ask the question of differ way based on information we provided which is usually the case you'll use based here until the river see on the conditional probability formula analogous our answer these theorem now the specific algorithm for class again
she is actually called naive that baby's made these classes are wiser called naive well this'll level to which all the probabilities in our formal actually depend on each other because they give it as like a mexican standoff it's like what is the probability of this given this guy this guy the other guy all day all depend on each other's excite figure like three guys with guns each other in all of nature also probability of this given that guy wall probably of this guy depends on the problem that i know yet while the probability of again
and on this guy this back to the wrong kind of mutually code dependents they may even the parts of naive days cuts off the dependents of events from each other it makes things not penetrated and this makes the algorithm tractebel able to be computed within reasonable amount of time without that naive eighty parts of the recall the naive that assumption the algorithm would be to computational a difficult for modern machines to perform and sonar to use basis
you're him and conditional probability in the wilds for mushy learning applications that introduces naive idiot sunshine which severs the dependents of events from on each other that assumes that they're all independent events now as we did was superb actor machines let's compare are naive days too deep learning made days is commonly used in text based applications like i said spam classification of e-mails study based off of words in the e-mail we call this a
bag of words approach is called bag awards because you're not assessing grammar or how words relate to each other you cannot swift maggie's days away words relates to each other remember that would be dependent events that would not be independent therefore we would not be using it to be naive assumption if we're is related to each other in the grammatical structure they would depend on each other and our approach could not be naive sort
owing to assume that they don't depend on each other instead we're just about the whole out all the words of the e-mail and we're just a necktie keep our eye on trigger words which by agra what is the probability of an e-mail this spam given that the existence of the word viag rot so that's what's called a bag of words just all works just ramona bag handbags the naive days they were currents neural network which is an algorithm the walk into the few trap sowed
is it it's height of neural network so it's a type of deep learning algorithm that is very good at handling tax base applications as well so naive days and ricardo networks are commonly pitted against each other but unlike naive days which is a bag of words and the naive assumption that there are no relations between the words were correct neural networks which really read the email from left to rights top to bottom and they keep grammar in mines negating were
as modify the words a negate mean i think i'm never colonel not work as taking an e-mail printing it out and said it's a classy english gentleman who sits in his leather sofa and he has uptight there are well the city's this is a viable us not be too hasty because they also some amount of anson in this in this particular structural hit that you find that they use abbreviations more often than real worthwhile these abbreviations these below that on educated guess investing for more grout will of the tribes safe precious stay
so that and you know what edgewise i believe through full analysis of the doctors and well indeed dealing with spam but that the guy almost a day to come to this conclusion but comparisons naive basis in their full lose arms is that cigar is mouths agape awe is as niagara the only other information for colonel network looks up from the papers as though yes of course that back room maybe because the probability beings that of course because obviously he's always causes the naive base snatches the paper out of the colonel networks hands we
that says that the goddamn big spending has biographical need to know painting else so it's kind and memory or crucial ter application is things need to be fast and not consume a lot of memory the naive days is a preferable chilling algorithm to add more complex outgrew mike rucker know my work but if you need more accuracy and complexity in the analysis of the situation then or colonel mill workers more likely to be your guide this time it in memory or less of an issue for your particular situation and you
other have higher accuracy in a more complex modeling of the situation and then keep learning it is preferable to naive base blasting about e-mail spam classification you don't have all day to determine if an e-mail is stamped when somebody sends an e-mail the recipient expects to receive the e-mail in very short order or less a knoll more than one minutes all very powerful record neural networks on very powerful machines could probably do that i'm in it but i'm not so sure where's
naive these class of fire could snap his fingers and make a judgment blink of an eye so the case of e-mail span classification is there like that case indeed been a few days crossfire is preferred to or colonel network and is a prime example where we see a shallow learning algorithm maybe better or for a particular purpose then a deep learning you know deep learning is more accurate and complex and magical effect this particular situation above using the record no man or
forty mil classification they called us feel natural language processing been using or colonel now works with what's called work vectors were beginning to another episode the way that it represents these documents is as a point in vector space they can be compared to other documents it's actually very magical summer so that the spin of natural language application using in this type of technology is called natural language in understanding which indicates if you my structure mind so far that the machine may be on
standing in a fundamental way the meaning behind what classify as a document es amor not spam very interesting indeed so there you have that support actor machines and naive days and i do want to admit i don't understand these are rooms as much as the algorithms that i have presented to you thus far so this is probably one of my worse episodes would encourage you to go learn these are britain's offline which brings us to the resources section of course the andrew being caught
sarah course he has a weak bond support vector machines will lead to that show notes into being that does not cover naive baze class fires i found that very interesting actually because naive base casa fires that's what the fundamental algorithms a machine learning b. c. brought up over over over compared to more complex models like like neural networks and used in the wild today with great success will see it in most introductory machine and textbooks noise things
so i can issuing cover in a daze i actually found the video by intruding on youtube unos trying to learn eight days later on naive basically clearly came from his course he took it out at some point i think that he didn't want to bog down newcomers to machine learning with statistics because like i said to understand i am days classifies it understand base theorem to understand is fairly have to understand initial probability donors
initial pablo you have to understand statistics so the whole world of these ian methods if the world of statistics raw statistics and stats is a hard stuff my friends so it's important it's essential but i have a hunch that intruding decided bill get to that later i don't want to scare them away from the field yet if you don't need it to succeed right away you can start to lanier logistic regression and indeed die right into deep learning annual my work's skip
asked all the statistics staff buddy it is essential for you to know so i would encourage you to learn naive days crossfire's the machine learning with our book that'll put nissho notes is it has a great chapter on naive days crossfire's dawson of the great chapter on support actor missions as well in the mathematical decision making great courses series that i've reference from time to time also has a whole episode audio episode decay
it's naive dates so all put spend the show notes that would encourage you to try to learn the basics of these two algorithms offline 'cause like as seminal figure did a very good job of presenting them unfortunately i prepared met prepared by little bit out of my helmet for this episode and file an issue before had you choose which algorithm to use when you know your situation whether calls for supervise learning a classification and regression is sarah will be alone narrowed down gross
which algorithms to throw out and now you have in your hands twenty our rooms if you could possibly use for classification and in order decide which of these algorithms you she used you assess your day yes so for example naive days works well with categorical dana and missing dana something many other mushy learning algorithms do not work well with this missing a gate at the day's work stay okay with missing and county examples the avenue training dataset we're working with tax or numbers cetera using these types of questions will help you narrow down even for
they're in order to do that i'm going to link to the table of pros and cons of various algorithms honors various situations and the decision tree put out by the psychic learned project for choosing an algorithm giving various circumstances in your problem and from there once you've got five algorithms to use skinny hands and you still don't know which of these five is best use you just try 'em all the trial all you see which one which one has the highest performance based on some of our huish
metrics in the next episode i'm going to be talking about some of more miscellaneous mushy learning algorithms things that are very dedicated so the last three organs i thought about decision tree is support back to machines and naive days crossfire's these are all very general purpose power tool machine learning our ribbons all three of these to basically be swapped with each other in and knowing which one goes where little bit difficult by the next episode the machine running out of line would be presenting to you are very specifically to high
eight two very specific use cases so it'll be a little bit easier logos apple sources that stomach easy for you to decide that yes you should uses are ruined because situations a or b. i'm going to be doing these episodes now every other weekend of become quite busy recently i apologize to run every week elder other rid himself so i'll see you two weekends from now


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash m. l. g. d. but i'm also starting a new contacts which could use your support and it's called last year's like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com for words slash l. l. h. this is episode fourteen shall earning algorithms periphery this is the third and final of the show
oh learning algorithms episode in this episode will actually be quite easy by comparison to the last two gallons of recovering this episode of our recommend nurse systems anomaly detection systems and marcus chains that commander systems anomaly detection systems are extremely easy to understand sol star with those they're also very specifically applied so you knocking you seize our rhythms may be all over the place like we did with last few algorithms namely support back to machines now
these days and decision trees have a lot of applications in this difficult to know when to use which where these algorithms recommend her systems anomaly attention are used specifically in those applications recommending things and detecting anomalies but actually start with anomaly detection excess even the easiest understands server software which you use an anomaly detection for for example fraud detection in credit card spacewalk figaro when something went far
awry with your credit card they wanna find some sort of transaction that didn't look typical it looked and it's it's not your typical spending habits or its overseas when you made most of your purchases today in america the way credit card fraud programs work or by using an anomaly detection systems they may indeed use the algorithm the envoy to be explaining in this episode war they've probably in my opinion moved on to deep warning think a lot of big corporations
has moved on to the blurring for much of their machine learning process another application both anomaly detection is fearing affordable wanna server is acting out visit spiking in seek you and ran usage swapped slop space now working etc it could be the case that maybe it got a very big loaded got asked to perform a task that is very heavy indeed mrs not anomalous and so implementing an anomaly detection system can see through that and figuring out when something is in d.
the comments of that a systems administrator could pay attention to this anomalous server activity so anomaly detection to have white application and real quick pak unexplained you how they work without getting into the details and that is simply to find an al wire on all bell curve that it is so simple you have a bell curve of typical behavior whether it's credit card transactions or server activity in a cluster is something in acts
and i'll wire something where were the right over here on the bell curve or wayward left over there then you have an anomaly that said let's break this down a bit first off let's describe what a bell curve that it's even if you haven't begun learning statistics on your quest still learning machine learning and you will as some point because statistics is the god math of machine learning i'm still certain that you have seen the bell curve it is the most fundamental component of statistics probably one of the most fundamental it
lesions on the universe defiant soul bull's eye may you're awful lot of mathematicians feathers here but in my humble opinion i think that the bell curve should be the symbol of mathematics is very likely already the symbol of statistics but i think it should be the symbol of mathematics proper so for example fewer represent various branches of science with different pictures for chemistry you might use of beaker little potion symbol filled with green liquid in bottles
or physics you use the adam with all the electrons swirling around the easiest image used for like adam the taxpayer for example for reacts the white development framework you know that someone talking about it's that adamson bullets used to represent physics inmate in many places maybe biology might be a cell but math we think emasculate ok what kind of picture by you you probably think of the eagles and c. squared my friends i propose that the symbol of mathematics be the bell curve the bell
curve or also known as the galaxy in the distribution or a normal distribution i believe it's called normal because it's the most common distribution of all and let me explain what a distribution is and distribution is how we were diego falls onto a graph so we've been working with david innes by cast series for example we've been talking about housing costs in portland oregon if you're throw your spreadsheet both houses just throw them all intergraph
by cost you a good bell curve you see that there is sort of an average cost of how was it swing the center and and things start to move away from a year on the high or rommel whoa soul you have fewer very cheap houses and fewer very expensive houses and most houses of some more in the middle soloway that this falls on a graph is you have your average the average cost of all your houses is the center of this bell is called bell curve this is shaped like a bell coming in from the left
it's slopes up and it keeps at the top rounds out comes back down slopes to the right thing goes off to infinity looks like a bell standing up so the center is your average this is called the mena your average of all the prices of houses in portland oregon and the reason is soaked whole reason is that he of your grasp on why access that is the number of samples taken from this distribution that's the number of houses that war of the average price
so so naturally it's the highest as you go off towards the left the slope down you start to reach the very cheap out wires houses that costs all lot less than the average and if you slow to the right you start to reach the very expensive al wires house is a cost a lot more than meets the meanest determines the central location of this bell curve and what's called the standard deviation determined the width of the bell curve so if your date it is why
legally disbursed if there is a huge range in housing costs a lot of very wide bell curve why it in short will have a very large standard deviation if you have a small range of costs so let's say the average is two hundred thousand dollars and nothing goes about to fifteen or plunder one fifty that'll be as skinny bell curve that's paul an uneasy of a small standard deviation so that's understanding the bell curve it's a very simple distribution
again so distribution means how we were gay it all falls on to the graph that soda distribution is a taking a sample of your distribution is taking one little house out of your day yet been looking at it and looking at the price okay so i sampled the d. n. a. in this house is a hundred and seventy two thousand dollars says taking a sample of your day at the house that i took its core random variable you are always words when you're working with statistics be they have always terms first off we are
working with distributions so probability distribution as all sorts of probability distributions out there i said the most common it is the galaxy and distribution within normal distribution aka the bell curve there is also things like the burn newly distribution or the multi new redistribution within normal distribution etc different graphs they look different depending on how the day that is formed and like they said i think this is one of the most magic
old and comment functions of the universe that you'll see is actually a mathematical function you can actually say like f. of x. equals and in this big mathematical equation on the right i'm not analyst now for you it's actually quite complex you would've isabel korea like okay the most common distribution the universe is gonna have a very simple formal it's actually pretty complex formula will see it in your dealings with statistics but anything that falls outside of the norm k. that's why we have this word the norm falls outside of our normal
distribution over here on the left her over here on the right very very very expensive houses on sock a million two million our house or you're on the left and the house it costs one dollar okay let her out wires big al wires really wants to get pasture standard deviation you typical waits on the left and right you didn't al wire territory but when it comes to the anomaly detection algorithm were more concerned with mate al liars things that fall really far on the right or left side is the system worked
oh you just build up a graph you are normal distribution representing your day that sold all how to servers typically accuracy few years common network usage years common disk usage and build up a normal distribution now the normal distribution but explaining so far is in two dimensional you got an x. and y. access by u. typically gonna be working with multi dimensional degas and it's hard to envision a multi dimensional normal distribution was a three d. looks little bit like a hill
once again the fortieth little bit you can really envision that bye birdie working with multi dimensional dana hands you just simply cannot find our wires now people earning bit of anomaly detection it is this little variable you learn called epsilon at epsilon basically is the fresh hold the you're going to learn what he had a small threshold earl large special would basically determines how sensitive you or or system is one working with al liars
and why he'll do what is your train your algorithm all i'm a normal stuff stuff it's not anomaly an annual tested against anomalies so for example they say that your training gail consist almost entirely of your native examples and then you're positive examples will be split mostly between your validation your tests at the reason for this is we want a system to be able to learn what's typical of your dana and then you're gonna basically be using your pal
wires to fine tune the hyper parameter of the anomaly detection algorithm which is called your capsule one variable and that's a it's so simple honestly excellent i've talked to long's i don't worry over think this it's so simple all is is coming up with a bell curve in one two three dimensions are many in figuring out what is mate al leiter it's a learning process is learning where is your fresh cold how sensitive or you to al liars so for example let's think about
the classroom setting where you have a bell curve of grades were the average grady is a b. b. is so baby is you are mean and so that's the number where on your graf on the x. axis the peak of your bell curve it is so very top of the bell curve you cover cool i'm right down the center and that number is the big off to the right you got a bunch of a b. plus a minus they ate was so people were getting a plus or on the far to the right for
apple in this smooth curve connecting to armenia and coming down to the left i'm going towards people who are getting b. minus c. plus c. c. minus indeed now let's say that that's basic where bell curve and we have one student who got an f. that's two falls very far outside the typical population of students therefore that student is more than just an hour wire the student is an anomaly as far as the teacher is concerned and so the teacher needs to go talk
festooned see you know what's going wrong and how committee to help the students that are so something that falls basically doesn't look anything like the rest of our population of pulled up outside that bell curve in a significant way that's the anomaly detection system is simple statistics gas in distribution so let's move on to recommend her systems recommend assistance or one of the most common applications machine running in the industry and i think they were one of the earliest applications of machine learning this
specially indeed commerce an online companies direct manner systems are exactly we think they are so for example amazon pandora spot five catholics at all recommends to you a product or a song or a movie based on things that you've liked in the past that basically ads if you think about it this isn't an system we call them rectum enter systems and there's two very common flavors of recommended systems one is called contents filtering
and another is called collaborative filtering so too common recommend ursus stomach algorithms and they're very very related to these the same underlying principles which will get into an addict in order to show you how all of these things are different and similar i'm going to use to popular internet radio cox one is called pandora and others called spawn a fly now by the way i believe this spot by his gotten a little bit more complex with the way they
work so what i made the misrepresenting the way the spawn of fireworks this is just how i understand spot fight to work so pretend that it works this way bear with me let's start with pandora pandora internet radio pandora he is a web sites where you can listen to some music and even like or dislike some songs i will play songs that are similar to things that you've liked and dissimilar to things that you don't like when you
go on to pandora and we first started says see the song or or it's like what gimme something mr west would you like and i say i like ryan adams he's my personal favorite musician is is okay i'll give you a few right out of songs listen to that three minutes another three minutes man with the set the second or third song comes on it is a new song says you're based on fact you like mine and i think you'll like orion or even brothers took place a new song for me make a juicy either thoms opted for thoms day
on it's hands as you found your way through the songs pandora learns your musical provinces it's got this thing called the music genome project's the idea being that all these workers at pandora have determined to for every single song it in the pandora database theories attributes about these songs things like male versus female vocals is instrumentals there some bases air guitar with genre of music is is what sub genre of music is
as an eighth tag all the songs the database with various tax when you like or dislike of song it's sort of frozen these tags to the dislike pool and these tags into the light pole it comes up with the sort of them diagram conceptually of the types of songs eli to listen to this now works underneath the hood the way it functionally works is by way of this thing called content filtering in content filtering your gun all of this is very easy understand because you're you know the algorithm the beauty use for content filtering
one of the algorithms we learned in the very early days of this series let me give you a hint what we're trying to do here is determined us or for a song in the whole day basis songs based upon your personal user preferences score is a numbered usually wearied working with rather manner systems like an athlete you might give a movie on anywhere between one and a five star rating solace for between one and five of the number it's numerical it is we grew ration
the case of an or it's a thumbs up or thumbs down to look look more like classification but i imagine on her leg pain or probably does some for conversion of your thumb to a score for example so we're working with the numbers were trying to protect the number that would go along with this song in the database given your use your preferences that you have built up over time given your fade out parameters this my friends is linear regression it's just like china per day
it cost of the house we've looked at hundreds of houses and we've come up with a bunch of faded parameters for protecting the numerical out what it's about when you throw in a new house admits it's ever seen before but it can look at the number bedrooms number back in the square foot is this is downtown etc on moines to guess i hundred seventy five thousand dollars using my fate parameters of this linear aggression a model so content filtering recommend her systems work exactly the same as linear rig rash
we've thrown in new song to the mix and i've already learned all these theta parameters by a thumbing my way through the songs this new song gets thrown into the linear regression algorithm an owl calms a score on a scale from one to five or zero to one or whenever i guess as to whether the usual like this song or not so it is linear regression there are some very seldom princes a you'll see we take a tangerine course between eared russian and content filtering but it's
so why are so they have at the first algorithm you ever learn for machine running when you're regression is used for recommend ursus sons also content filtering now there's a problem here the problem is this thing called the music genome project the music genome project is this process where workers that pandora worked hacking at every single song in the database with various tags hundreds of tanks are thinking of thousands of tags tiger represent various features remember features were you were
in one form or part of a machine running on the songs that is very time consuming and it is often very difficult to do you if you have the time on your hands you have to listen to each song one at a time when you have to have a lot of musical knowledge we have to know how to apply these features songs what you're looking now for usually we don't have this kind of time nor the expertise for tagging every piece of content in the database and especially as new content
yeah it's a baby's cry silly constantly in fact i do not think that this music genome project that pandora is being applied manually anymore at all i believe that pandora's unit radio is using a deep learning and audio analysis machine learning algorithm to determine what the jurors are associated with new songs as they come in and although tag them with these features i'll think there's any human listeners there anymore and leave their robot listeners new
saying it deep learning algorithms less crittenden you can't even do that or this too difficult for you to the new circumstances so for example for example cameras on his new products are being corsa we added to the database you relate to hide them with features why you're interested in or what a user might be interested in is what other users have looked at were white or purchase so this is to my understanding how spot of fireworks be competitor to
and your internet radio like acid don't call me on it they may have changed their algorithm sense by the way i understand spotlight to work is what's called a call labyrinth of filtering it is users are also liked so not similar songs based on various features about songs but users are also liked an amazon and that flakes and in fact alice say the majority of wright commander systems out there use call aberdeen filter
and rather than content filtering users also liked rather than a similar items have a call abusers also liked he is to determine similarity between a products or songs or movies it is indeed trying to figure out similarity between products to recommend to you but it is not by way of attributes of the product itself but rather by finding users who were similar to your purchasing preferences and
earring out what they also liked to you there's also liked is the call labyrinth filtering algorithm and i'm gonna cut can waive my way through this hour room you'll learn the details may intruding course but the way it works is really kind of nifty is linear regression and yet again bites you don't have features of the products to work with in building not be worth a vector for each user you don't have the features you don't have those numbers and
so we you're going to build up those features yourself to honest which examples to movies math works for example to make this little bit clearer to describe let's say that user k. is intercity dan fantasy movies maybe some side by side he doesn't like romance he loves action in user be blows all romance in the finger is that like action hates fantasy inside fact they so we get the screech you opposite users and in the database for revues be content filtering recommend or how
over them all the data base would be pre populated with how much fantasy and how much romance and how much thriller is associated with each movie but since we're moving on to call operative filtering the rectum enters systems we'll have those features every movie is a blank slate is an empty vector of features now we don't even know what to call these features we're we don't know that we're necessarily can be learning the amount of sight fire the amount of thriller were just in al okay let's eight
and features for every movie and when you sergei rates movie k. and user aways movie b. and we see the movie d. we start to figure out the common theme of what this user likes so we can start to build up a numerical representation for each movie factor is actually linear regression in the reverse we're using basically the movies are learning their fate of planners from users scoring system then we're going to use those learned features two
and guess what users will like so then we switch again the other direction what we have is a linear regression flipping sides over and over users great movies from that movies learn their features from that you will recommend movies users break those recommendations from that movie learned his features et cetera so we have this infinity loop of linear regression between the movie
use and the users is really pretty magical it's really cool as an incentive loop of linear regression so you might imagine just cause so we'll be in code you have this running loop of two linear regression models that's also actually what you can do is you can put both linear regression miles into the same equation little trick or you can put two linear regression son to wander into one mathematical formula and now you have one
that model and that is your call operative filtering recommend her system and there you have africa manner systems so true spins of wright commander systems one is called content filtering and that's the preferred one to use when you can and do how of features hide your contact the database do you have a bunch of information associate with each book or movie or product yes use content filtering it he'll have that information anyone all learned that information
by way of your users rating were purchasing worry ninjas viewing products you can use this twist sis system called clobbered of filtering which is basically like an infinite luke linear regression between the contents and the users as best thought of in my opinion it has user is also liked so content filtering is similar items clobbered filtering is users also liked out all the above ball from these are intended to be sim
we're items they just work off of different principles beloved about the name the reasoning court content filtering is because you have features on the contents itself the content itself has features in using that to filter down things that users will like content filtering worth call labyrinth filtering is your content is call lab worrying with the users and users are cooperating with each other to help make recommendations recommend ursus and very simple now i wanna make a
distinction clear we talked about an algorithm of prior episode called a market basket algorithm or an op for yuri oliver them for determining what items gold typically with what bothered by it and so for example of the earnest or anew by marshmallows and graham crackers what she you also by with that well the answer is hershey's chocolate this is different fromm recommend her systems or recommend nurse system finds similar items in other words if i like
hershey's chocolate and i'd also like a snickers bar or kit kat bar it's basically something to replace what you have in your hands i ate what i had in my hand i liked what i have my hand give me another one of those something similar to that we're as market basket or opry worry algorithms are for finding things to go with what you have i bought diapers i also want beer and finally i'm going to explain an algorithm called markoff chain
it's an update arkady kol the and this maze seem whole ill that we're in and out of place if you are a machine learning engineer and you're familiar with all the education omits your religious cult listening to this fond including markoff chains here may seem all that we're one is not one of those while one machine learning algorithms that you typically get exposed to it actually will seldom see exposed to lay her down the pike especially when you're starting to dive into reinforcement wow
ming territory doesn't necessarily so there you can use marcus chains in various aspects of mathematical decision making babies little bit more common like operations research for example or or control theory but it is a machine learning algorithms you may see it from time to time but you're not very likely to see it as a newcomer to machine learning is not the wa no one algorithm so why am i explaining it now the reason i'm explaining is because it is brought up all
that's from time to time you're going to see markoff chains and monte carlo war monte carlo marcus chains and c. n. c. you can see them these words thrown around all over the place stands for me personally went for started getting into machine learning and i never saw these are rhythms described in my books or my videos or intervene or anything i fell like alice missing something was very curious what marcus chains or at least in principle so i'm explaining marcus change religious to kind of ease your mind explain some
the arena c. from time to time but tell you now that you're not going to be using marcus chains anytime soon you're going to probably see this stuff once you get to reinforce that learning is the court all room of artificial intelligence it's the base the foundation of reinforcement learning upon which you'll use deepening principles of stuff to go deeper and deeper but markoff chains or the linear regression of reinforcement learning so let's explain how
they work on real dramatic here bear with me imagine you're playing a video game and you're a barbarian and you have just stumbled on the last box in his way or the dark lord this flames and darkness everywhere the dark lord turns to face you with his flaming demonic eyes he says calmly bureau and you grin darkly you buckle down any star running at heathrow us fireballs and dark spells it you when you got lofton like casting gas leak
shadows in your wake he made one giant launch a new gown off the ground leaping into the air when she seemed a great soared from your back twirling in your hands locking in a place coming down for a blow the dark lord golf roddy spring up his upon for defense and fleas i'm the narrator of this game and i stepped in and is seen as a barbarian dark lord come with me maples turn to maine and follow me into the game room the game room where i have them both sit down a dark lord
apparently used to sit down and i use my laser pointer to points to the scene that they were just in the barbieri it is suspended in the air with his great sort coming down for a blow the dark lord is bringing his on again from the left to block deflect the blow as a dark colored waiting is to happen here and says o. r. don't know what is complicated yes yes yes but what's the probability of the barbarian landing noble whilst i mean you have your arm coming into molested a block he's over here with his project
reed and his velocity all this the dark lord scratches his chin he looks the barbieri the barbieri mugs and shrubs and he looks back at the scene and he's decisive assess the history of this seed well he was well he jumped through the air after you is dodging left and right from my magic spells i come off as a dark lord dark or the magic spells don't matter that's all bygones at this point he's in the air with his sword common down a u. does it matter that he dodged your fireballs and your dark spells
in fact dark lord does anything in history matter op and to this point the dark wood scratching his chin and he's looking at the picture and as a slate blue trajectory showing the path that the barbarian had taken up and to this point it barks bruni error in his jump trajectory comes off the ground zigzags worries dodge those spells and stops where he'd entered the room surely that trajectory is important the dark lord's
is that if our look at this blue line like a few days common as a no no no dark colored nevermind blue line history doesn't matter up into the sport all that matters is and now all that matters is now this is called the markoff principal while male explained the players history up until this point that has made clear barbarian is absolutely essential for this battle the player has will not gain in strength and agility fought various bad guy
gained experience both as a player and it has a role played a barbarian he learned some spells he's earned some weapons and armor so the players history certainly should make a difference in the outcome of this battle but we can boil all black history down into a handful of numbers will level strength agility experience et cetera in other words we keep you race history if we know the presents or rather we can
boil all of history down into the present this is the markoff principle of play the mark of principal says history is irrelevant for determining the future and in certain models in certain circumstances and this may be just one now that all seems fine then you let the players history is condensed down into their level strength agility what about this trajectory that is sending the player down onto the dark lord to deal is strong blow does
that depend on this sort of blue line sri sing them through this dark lord slayer leaping through the air and on to the dark lord told the steps in history matter yes they do but they can all be boiled down into a handful of variables all the presents as well so maginnis blew my mind hoechst get sucked into the user flashing blue lights and now you have an arrow pointing downward quarter of the dark lord coming out this or wrappers
named trajectory and velocity of course we also have those variables strength agility local etc so you can boil all of the history in this video game including the wax fuel milliseconds down into the present all lay the presents trajectory and velocity acceleration strength agility center a handful variables that represents the present state we call it states the dark lord has some state funds
off he has the trajectory his own arm and how strong is he can he make a good defense those other things going on in the environment may be the dark lord has some minions are currently shooting arrows at hero so the history only matters is so far it can as it can be boiled down into the present that is the mark of principal at play the market principal says that the next the market principal says that the next state only depends on the current state so the next day depends on the current state
and in that state in a mark up chain is a series of probabilities a series of probabilities chaining their way through an action sequence self words apple in our current state the state being comprise the love the users lovell where he is acceleration velocity trajectory etc combine that with the dark lord's position his arms trajectory and velocity the configuration of minions all those things that's the current state the next state can be too determined by the
current states and some probabilities let's say that given up all that information the probability that he delivered a blow is eighty percent probability that he is blocked by a the dark lord is ten percent and probability that he misses five percent in the probability it's club to buy a minions arrow is another five percent so we can use these probabilities these percentages to determine how likely is for each possible next state we're in the current state imagine trying circle around
our current state and trying to forty arose out of that current state of the number next to the arrow is the probability of it happening and the circle in that next stay with your points is the state itself swell onex state being delivered a blow another next state being cooked by a narrow another being blocked by the dark lord another being myths are marked off chain then it is a sequence of actions in time you start in the beginning of the video game yeah some probabilities
of maybe one left arm right going forward improbably few and far into going forward again we're waiting there if you go forward again i'm probably picking up the sore or you can ignore the sort of sequence of actions all pointing to each other and leading eventually to the end these actions can look back on each other what's called a cycle which makes the markoff chain of a graph the grass and computer science you can see these alot of graff is a sequence of things that can look back on them so
folks if there is no such luke is called a tree decided decision tree from a prior episode remember i explained decision tree similarly you have a circle and out of that calmed somewhat arrows point to next circles this decision tree goes like this is my mother's in town we go over here okay if she's hungry we'd go to this restaurant if she's nonchalance and drink to these bars okay i've she's in the mood for this to that bar few you this'll about arthur decision tree looks very similar to a market chain is some difference is a marked off che
as a graph c. to have cycles and accordingly a mark of chain is basically a case sequence of probably stick actions in time it's a process the system are running loop of action sequences if you well the decision sri looks like a process or a system but it's not really you input some input to malcolm's an outlet it's a regression algorithm or classification our remaining comes you're employed snap your fingers do the decision tree out comes a number
reclassification where the markoff chain or a markoff decision process as you'll see in reinforcement learning is a sort of running loop sequence of actions is something that may determine the actions taken by an artificially intelligent agent for example in our video game analogy or may describe the action sequence taken by customers or components in the system so it's more of like a time based system or process sequence of actions
we're the decision tree is a symbol algorithm for computing it out but somehow i asked the dark lord again so what happens next uses are now why y'all given this current state with a trajectory and velocity of this or he's going to deliver the book with probability of eighty percent that's this morning for an old answer i say yes dark lord good job now that the market's changed when they do one more example this example comes out of the mathematical decision making great course
a series that i recommend over over that goes like this let's say that you restaurant is mauled by a markoff chain the group or an individual or whatever can enter the restaurant case a tougher states the next state is they are waiting for table you have a fifty percent probability of moving on from there to being seated by the hostess or a fifty percent probability of holding back on to yourself in other words you're still waiting okay so we enter this markoff chain and
we may be going back and back and back to back into our current state which is simply waiting then eventually we'll leave that state with probability fifty percent to basically is cut like that crime it takes to leave the state so like the time it takes to stop waiting in to get seated cotton is based on the probability is if let's say ninety nine percent probability staying in the waiting period in your way for very long time when one percent chance of acceding mending see it is fifty fifty then you will wait for very long
it's the air table you're in a new states the three you can order or are you still need time besides so you have a loop back to your current state you back to back you look back to try to decide and finally decided so you call over the waiter and you wore that brings into new state of waiting for food etc so you've got this graph of circles representing states that you could possibly be in at the restaurant with probabilities also at saving your state into a new state that's all market chain the market
channel of the different than the other machine running out of them zewe seen so far in that it represents the sequence of actions that's what marcus chained guys now we've seen near aggression logistic regression the selleck snapping your fingers and coming up with an estimate summary says what's this house can cost any step two fingers and you say eight hundred seven five thousand dollars next those are different than a mark of chain which is new and turkey system the system or a sequence of actions you take
areas actions depending on the probability of taking that action in a case system and you navigate your way through the system from our craft chain now marcus chaining can be it represented a dna matrix form a markoff matrix and that's just the mathematical convenience for representing the chain the chain that i was describing what circles and arrows that's for visualization purposes it makes sense to look at on a piece of paper for us the way you actually were
isn't this mathematically order computers with a matrix just like almost everything with machine learning the way we represent most things in machinery mathematically isn't matrix form that's why linear algebra so important now you might use the markoff chain him the operations researcher mathematical decision-making sort of to come up with an assessment of how long it takes for user to maybe leave the rash on or where is the bottleneck in your restaurant system where it
a fine users staying the most well maybe we want them to leave or where we find a state where are they haven't yet paid for their meal and the probability of leaving so the next eighteen weaver is higher than we want we can use them are cough chained to sort of model assistant incredulous acid figuring out what's going wrong figure out where bottlenecks are not we come up with these probabilities not first place while we do that just through
observing degas we have years and years and years of users coming in and doing various things alice pretend over there in the chorus and statistician and he's riding on a clipboard every time a user leave the table or every time i use orders food and so eventually can come up with some sort of probability of a thing happening next given the current state again the thing that makes us mark who vienna thing that makes a market system is that no current state depends on
prior states we have all prior state information is encapsulated in the current state the fact that i'm sitting at table must necessarily mean that i waited at some point for table and i can't hurt the restaurant all prior states all the history can be boiled down into the present so that some argus chain dallas go back to the game room with the dark lord we asked the dark lord is this player going to win the dark lord looks at you will to the barbarian
you look back you sir i don't know that's to load of a question as to what incredible reporters you cannot analytically use this market chained to come up with a simple numerical i'll put probability of the user winning when there's too many variables that play in a more coughed chain is said and using some mathematical formula to snap our fingers and come up with the judgment we use what's called a monte carlo simulation monte carlo marcus chain ought to carlos basically just
earning a series of simulations all were no word over until we get sort of a it's what's called an expectation unexpected valued seal lot of us were needed to reinforce that learning learning simulations over over over into you get what you think to be the most probable cancer because in mathematics way you are solving an equation worth system of equations that we're fingers coming up with a judgment because saw an equation analytically analytically so when you can basically calm up with a mathematical formula
that takes an input now comes out when you can just add two fingers and bone you're doing something analytically will when something is too complex to do an olympic lay it then we might try different trudges through my trial like durations for loops for example in this case in the case law monte carlo simulation we're going to basically run simulations of this clay are playing a video game over and over and over and over and over until we basically start to confer
urge converge they call it when you start to see a pattern on to what we think is going to be expected value the expected value being the final score what is the average final score that i'm starting to see it over time when i'm simulating a running the user through this video game okay so monte carlo markets chain let's take it for the top here is how it happens the user enters the dark lord's way or the dark lord times around and said
call me hero and a barbarian bottles down with a dark when when she says great sort whirled around his hand walks in the place and then five hundred thousand ghost images of the barbarian ryan in different directions when those lifelong goes right on before another is already dodging left dodging right dodging left gets hit by a fireball and diets dissipates into the air the other one is jumping into the air yet another was blocking the fireball with us
she'll call five hundred thousand simulations ghostly heroes are running through this scene killing the dark lord being killed by the dark lord missing getting caught by a narrow kill kill by guy killed him to that moment and finally we succeed a score of seven nine three to six eight that seems to be the confer urged expected value of this monte carlo marcus chain simulation so the chain the markoff changes in five minutes
eat what happens next all probability of point nine this standpoint one that monte carlo part is running for a bunch of simulations the oslo the complex the way basically a one of these ghost heroes ones to stay two and our guest this i'd see him run to state three four five well we take this thing with the highest probability with that probability and sometimes we take the things of lower probabilities this is kind that monte carlo process this whole system to this there's this algorithm cold
topless hastings algorithm random walk etc but basically that's and c. and c. monte carlo mark of chains in a nutshell is that you have the chain or a graph of states and neck states are all determined probable was thickly given your current state are running through that whole series with simulations is the monte carlo bit now like i said you're going to be seeing this mark hoffer chain in a reinforcement learning and or official intelligence
when i see that they're all walks there is called a markoff besiege and process them that the key and this might be for example the algorithm that sits in the core of the brain of the dark lord the dark lord is the artificial intelligence that is fighting you you were the player the dark lord is that ai this fighting you it's not again if i knew if the dark lord big game is basically the physics system the rules hands of the markoff chain
the thing that says given state wanna what is the probability of being in what is the probability transitioning to two three or four and the dark lord needs to act upon this decision given probabilities groomed for men what is the best next action to take to the area and m. c. and see him and the resources section of this episode it's just gonna be all linked to week nine of entertains corsair course on anomaly detection and recommend nurses sounds very simple and at kansas
theories on shallow learning algorithms the next episode is going to be the most boring episode of all is going to be basically the parts of machine learning algorithms things like performance evaluation underfunding and over fitting regular is asian and all that really boring stuff it's all on fortune only essential and machine learning your alertness of actually really early on elsewhere like in asia
being a series i've decided that point on it for awhile because it's just so boring way yes they have dessert first and vegetables later by olga that's over with animal move on to the fun stuff all seen as that


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash and algae and get the time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks the sum which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode fifteen performance this episode is going to be the last of the
the six machine learning my friends at this point you have now gone through all the very fundamental introductory components of machine learning a shallow learning the basics of deep learning a little bit of the math and technology and finally this episode we're not talk about performance evaluation and performance improvements e-mail heard about things like hide bias and hide variants or fitting in under fitting regular is asian men accuracy fusion major sees all these things
this is going to be a very boring episode unfortunately i apologize your wanted coffee for this episode let's just get it over with and the deep end of this episode you will be an official machine learning power want my friends you have come far applied yourself so let's do this episode see you can call yourself a machine manner in this episode we're gonna be talking about performance performance evaluation and performance improvements no performance is basically greeting at your mushy
learning algorithms how well did your machine learning to the task he was given so for example classifying spam guessing housing costs of portland house is calling things cats dogs and humans all of the machinery applications that we've talked about fire episodes we want a measure to determine how well machine learning algorithms or do we need at performing their job now you may be thinking wait a minute we already have the performance measure don't
we we had this three part machine learning sequence we have predict error or functions okay and then learning now we will learn based on these error functions nigger functions tell us how poorly we're predicting so that we can improve upon those productions by using the learning sat by using calculus that's true this error function or this loss function that exists in every machine learning algorithm can be used to measure the performance of the opera
so they can prove itself however the loss or terror function of a machine learning how rhythm differs from machine learning algorithm to algorithm each error function is different for these different algorithms that because these algorithms function differently the learning step of the jogger the metropolis components is different depending on the structure of the algorithm or when we're dealing with neural networks we have this back propagation process that uses greedy and to say
that each new on in a backwards pass through the network which is totally different than decision trees which is a thing called entropy howl chaotic is all the information at any given level the tree which also the phone logistic herb russian with which uses cross and chirpy so every hour that has a different their function annie's error functions or like subjective personal error functions is basically a personal gauge on how well you're doing al
as a algorithm and by which you can improve yourself where is the performance metrics that we're gonna be talking about in this episode or more of a universal greed like a baby c. d. f. grade that you can compare machine learning how rhythms against each other so this matter to really talk about school accuracy will talk about that later burnett get into the analogy first this magic accuracy is very similar to what the final grade the end of a semester
or by taking a final test and getting back eight percent score from zero to one hundred percent and you can use that grade to compare our runs against each other for particular task or you can use that great to basically informing the single she learning our grimaced how well it's doing overall so let's use this analogy taking a class let's pretend that this class discourse at university is the spam of detection course again remember how we said that there is machine lowering our rooms
and be used for various purposes som are very specific such as anomaly detection algorithms and recommend her systems but some are all other more universal such as naive days decision trees neural networks and support vector machines these power algorithms so we may have a situation such as spam classification for example where we can use a number i'll rhythms well we're gonna put all these algorithms into a classroom class that is the detecting spam claw
asked and university and we're going to give them textbooks and assignments and quizzes and tests at the end of the course of their gone all get the final grade would soften how well they didn't know morgan use that great ourselves to determine which of these machine lowering our rooms we will select for the purpose who got the highest grade class the learning phase in this class is these students these individual machine learning algorithms trying to learn what it means to be spam when we're looking at you
ales what makes an e-mail ham that is not spam versus spam so they're going home a take on these assignments and our reading the text book an or crunching incontinent crunching this is the training phase of machine learning and each of these algorithms has it's own metric that uses to figure out how well it thinks it's doing in the class so we've got one learning algorithm naive days and he's the father of three kids may have that really taxing job it comes home
reunite he studies any studies and he gets a little sleepy listens to lectures on his ipod on the way to work and he studies in the break room and he just beating himself octopi don't have enough times daddy i'm not that passes class speeding himself up and he takes a test needed to be so surprise oh my gosh i'm doing pre well bye-bye to improve it looks like i may be to focus on some of these and not focus on some of these other things too is that this matter that he kind of compares himself against that's his loss function is error function
basically his own subjective personal care or function for how well you do in class that we have another algorithm over here over them be logistic regression an easy game or and he's playing games played out in this class i'm fine one day he actually studies an hour and a textbook and he's congratulating himself oh my gosh i'm doing so much better than i usually do i am going to nail this class studies got his own performance magic that he's had comparing itself against well the end of the class rolls around to take a final test they get
their scores and yes you did better the father of three kids so they each have their own loesser air function of their own personal subjective performance metric that they used to tune their learning process and then there is a final grade which is this performance evaluation magic to work and talk about things like accuracy and asked to score noise things still basically inform objectively war universally how our rooms are performing against each other or how well the algorithm did it in general
this class at this particular tasks which in this case is spam classification this performance measure the subject of performance measure that measures algorithms against each other we call this accuracy is simply how many questions did you get right over all over all the questions available very simple accuracy the case of classification spam class occasion how many e-mails did you correctly classified as spam or correctly classified as him over how many total accurate
a very simple it's not always as simple sometimes the task is a little bit more complicated for example let's say the task is classifying cancer not spam cancer well cancer is let's say one percent of the population were spam it may be well it's not actually fifty fifty blessed pretend it's fifty fifty well classifying spam versus not spam takes live know how if it's gonna be fifty fifty breakdown but classifying cancer
says non cancer can be done with a very simple learning technique learning to always classified not cancer why it because of cancer is only one person of the population then you will be ninety nine percent accurate if you always classify it a patient as not having cancer so the accuracy measure of number of corrects over a number total will not do in this particular case so for this amplification course and you never
city there are a machine learning students were all taking in and we met at the mall against each other the keys to the final test that is the use is going to be a different key then in the oncology class we're learning to classify cancer is going to be a different key to the professor uses to grade the final performance evaluation of the machine running our rhythms so we don't use accuracy in these ads cases so what we do varies on a case by case basis based on the machine learning task
that hands the more we have or are these two measures that we can balance against each other given the circumstances again and these two measures are called precision and recall precision and recall precision is when you're making a gas do you always make the perfect gas and then recall is kind of like how why do you cast your nets so i think of the definitions of precision recall by way of an analogy to a video game i play called robo
we called for recalls in the very name of the game and in fact you do have these little measures precision and recall at the end of your game play precision is like how precise you are that's the definition of precision how precise you are how much of a straight shooter you are do you mean never miss a shot you take he is at every shot you take a perfect head shots you never miss a shot then you have perfect precision the higher the precision of the better you
or shots that you take you never missed a shot you take high precision you are a precise shooter he were a straight shooter the purpose of the game the story is that is always robots and there is a virus now turned evil and have told robots is called robo recall because you work for the company that made these robots and so it's your job to recall the defective products right you're trying to recall the products which means you're going on field you're killing all robots sold the amount of robots you
he'll use the amount of robots you we called the amount of defective products you recall back to the factory so your precision is how sharp assure you were you always make the head shots and the recall is how many robots you killed in one level and their balanced against each other you i don't care how good a sure you are you can possibly have perfect precision never miss schott and perfect recall kill all robots so there's some sort of balance you want maybe on
a decent amount of precision were you gonna don't miss too many committees in our recall where balance against the precision you're killing a lot robots some assets or get back here precision and recall is your beard trying to balance some level of how precise you are when you make your shots versus how many things you get right over all know let's bring us back to stand in cancer analogy in the case of cancer you want i recall you want to throw a wide net why is
that because you are okay it may be falsely classifying some people with cancer because you never want to miss the people who do have cancer you would rather make false positives then miss any shots so you wanna hire recon the case of cancer you want to cast a wider net you're okay accidentally classifying people don't have cancer the long as you always classify the people with cancer in the case with spam you walk every shot you take to
hit the spam e-mail and you'll let some spam come into the in box at the expense of casting a wide net why because of the past two white men that you might ask billy send hamlet in an e-mail to the spam box that would be very unacceptable you would rather the user get a few spam e-mails per day let some through lower we call rather than acts that way it sends a non spam to the spam box sell every shot me take you wanna
head shot your spam e-mails high precision so different edge case machine learning situations called for different performance measures the general kind of catchall measure we use is called accuracy and if your situation is look at edge case then now we have this sliding scale let's say we have a slider with the mob we can always left with precision a war always to the right with recall and there's some maybe it's sweet spot for this thirty two
are our room where you slide that knob until just so and it's it's really good freer situation unless they met that standard performance measure that we call accuracy is whether slater is right in the middle so accuracy precision and we call them is is another matter called and asked for and there's different types of test scores f one f two etc dot com and once you just have to soak up and asked to score which sort of measures the balance of precision versus recall what kind of a mathematical clayton
gives you the location of that knob on the slider and i'm talking about what it's like left ago precision sweater right you'll recall that f. to score kind of tell us where that knob is on the slider and so you use that for different situations other things you'll see in that this space of performance evaluation when you're reading around one thing is called a confusion matrix okay when you classify stamina and ham you can make true and false negatives and pas
that's good for options you can make it true positive a false positive it true negative a false negative for you're when you're making your guess is new classifying spam so eight sure positive that is when you correctly classified spam a false positives as we said it was spam but it wasn't a true negative that is when you said it was ham and it was him and a false negative as we said it was ham but it was spam so for options and put them together on the grid
a two by two matrix you recall this little matrix a confusion matrix doesn't have to be two by two of their multiple classes that we're trying to identify said he kept on human endeavor three by three et cetera and this is kind of like the key that you were professor of the spam class will use at the end of the class to too great your final test this confusion matrix is how old your professor will sort of visualize the things that you are wrong nothing's eighty
got right now you don't use this performance evaluation metric whether the accuracy your nest to score or not you don't use it to train your algorithm you use it to grade york algorithm you use your algorithms error function to train the algorithm sell your algorithms taken a class and he's adjusting himself based on that because i'm a grades and the quiz grades in always things in his life decision
isn't this union nor sleep etc improves and self improvement self pity and the class we get a final grade and that tells us how well or algorithm did john salvi performance metric is not for training is for greedy now how does this work what we'll do is we have data we have our spreadsheets both houses in portland where we're trying to estimate a cost of a house given its features we have a spreadsheet must say it's a hundred thousand rose will do
what is will take a need to put aside and that will be used for training your rhythm in other words eighty percent of this spreadsheet is our algorithms steady material it's it's textbook it's it's homework assignments eighty percent is called the training day that the training set so we just took our spreadsheet we caught it exhibits the student and twenty percent goes to offset the professor we call this the tests that an assist has said that were used to grade the fine
performance of the algorithm this is the final test the final that you give to the end of the semester is art hast set so we take our tests that of features and we have the hawaii values the actual prices of these houses but we hold them behind our backs sort of this is the test he so we put all those rose as questions on the final test and we hand that's to the machine learning algorithm which sago answered all questions and gives us the test
can we look at we compared against the key that we have and we agree it's now there is little something called a hyper parameters when a machine learning algorithm learns remember linear regression and logistic regression episodes we talked about these things called parameters fade out parameters specifically a parameter is a coefficient the machine running over them learns it's the number that goes in front of acts that this is multiplication
keith's that the machine learning our room learns in order to construct an equation that fits all lying to the date parameters that is the stuff the machine of rumors but there are other components to a machine learning algorithm stuff that it does not to learn that can be tweaked to improve and algorithms performance so for example we were talking about linear regression we said that the d. m. may not optimal eat beef it will line it could be just sold that may be lost
squiggles or earth it says exponential functional look for the op or something like that so the amount of holan no meals in a linear regression algorithm that's called a hyper parameter it's not a parameter the machine learning all the more and it's something that we'd squeak as a human hyper parameter is a thing that the human tweaks subs can avoid allowable above the algorithm the controls the algorithm
then the arbor them learns it's faded parameters and do the restriction of the hyper parameters that we impose upon the algorithm i think the best way to visualize this is with the hyper parameters of the neural network piper parameters of the neural network are the number of new ron's in any layer and the number of way or it's in the network so how wide and how deep is our network you might think well it seems like the optimal neural network would just be
the biggest brain ever let's just have a brazilian layers deep and a brazilian neurons why at each layer when the baby's brain ever be the best neural network not necessarily the size of the network is particular to this circumstance if the situation is simple been having too many layers or too many neurons actually causes something called over fitting the real be getting into towards the end this episode another problem with two complex
of the neural network is that build more complex than network the more training day yes than no work needs to eat two understands the situation if you've got a spread sheet of hundred thousand rose by yellow the zillion neurons that's not enough information and you could probably never get enough information with that complex of a network so you slam your network down to accommodate the amount of d. day you have available furthermore the more complex your neural network
the more computational resources required to many neurons means your computer just can't handle it so you actually want to have that as slim down in your network as possible as small a brain as possible that can optimal we handle the situation at hands so the number of neurons in the number of lawyers or your hyper parameters in you as a human shoes the hyper parameters that best fit your circumstances based on
your understanding of the situation so it takes actually understanding on the human part in order to optimize is hyper parameters now that takes away a little bit of the magic doesn't it we have machine learning algorithms that learned the information that you're giving it but there's some stuff about the machine going on than a dozen wherein you have to tweak yeah so so viper parameters live there are on their our libraries out there that automate is process is not actually machine learning it's it's more lie
you're reading through a handful of different combinations of hyper parameters given these restrictions you get it and finding the thing that she is the best performance metric using that evaluations that we talked about an earlier part of this episode was now machine learning proper basis of their libraries out there that can cycle through paper parameters run your machine learning our rhythm against it against the performance evaluation and squeak the hyper parameters until it gets the best score possible so these hyper parameters are thing
that week sweetie and so what we do is we added a petition all step to this train and test process okay so training machine learning algorithm has the algorithm tweaking it's parameters of theta parameters nikkei so guinier images aggression and in the final test just told us the overall score of the machine on in our room at performed we had this third piece called of allegations that allows us to kyle i'd stop look at how leo
that was performing before we get our final grade and if we sort of have a hunch on how we can make some changes to these hibor parameters we can tweak them the making quick go again on the training phase and your brother can we trained given that be adjusted hyper parameters to call us that the validation step so now we have and i think of this in our university course analogy as the mid term the midterm so it's just seconds tax we insert in the middle of the semester that
measures the performance of the machine learning our room about allows us to kind of step in and change the hyper parameters an asset backed out and lego dentist alike we have our machine learning algorithms are taking this course and they've got their internal measure of their own performance so i think i'm doing that i think i'm doing good they're making some adjustments the way they steady okay they start to realize that they fully understand concept day that they may be needs to focus little bit more concept be so they have their loss function cross
and chirpy for example and eight adjust their fate of parameters adjust their fate of climbers they learn learn learn the coarse material and we give them a mid term and they get this great back and elect will see a fire was duro well and so we pull him aside as a human k. we turn them off as if off switch on their back 'cause these are learning machines after all they're robots right and we open up their skull and how little robot brain inside we take our read to me take her screwdriver him
to tweak turn turn turn we make some adjustments to the hyper parameters whether it be number pollen o'neill's no linear regression algorithm or number of layers or neurons in a neural network and we close lynam ahead we put back into its class and it starts to learn learn learn that we can actually made retake the midterm panic is a this time great is actually improved so i think we're ready to take that final test and she moaning over the text has gets the cell trainee is learning
we have a mid term which lets us peek into how well we're doing and make any necessary changes store hyper parameters is called a validation step and we have our final tests which tells us are greedy for the semester so we split or spreadsheet into three chunks let's say it's sixty percent training degas that's the stuff that the machine in our rooms in all learn from and then twenty percent validation sets that's the stuff that we're going to test the machine
earning power over them on a midterm to see if there's any sort of hyper parameter adjustments we should make to improve the algorithms overall performance in there we have our final test with the tests that and that tells us the overall score says is called the process is called across a validation we split our spreadsheet are dana into three chunks training sets validation sets antacids and we use that day yet to train validated see if we need to make the header primer judgments and tax
final evaluation okay so we have a way of measuring algorithm a performance bulls gets itself with the loss function against each other with a performance magic like accuracy then we can use this grade to decide which algorithm to use for or particular purposes but what could go wrong in an algorithm that could mock up its performance what could cause an algorithm to be less performance than another algorithm it could be that one out of mischief
the better fit to give him the day yet why it could be a handful of other things things that can improve weary talked about hyper plan or adjustments those are things that we get it but just to improve our algorithms performance sama algorithms require more d. n. to learn from then on their algorithms so one thing we can do to improve performance is just collect more data so for example we split up r. j. get into training of validation and tests that we just dill
looted the amount of d. n. a. that an algorithm has to work with when it's steady wanted learning some algorithms work fantastic with very little d. n. a naive days in particular works is very well even with little day that whereas neural networks need lots and lots of data to train with so one way to improve performance is to collect more data another way to improve performance is sometimes the day that actually needs massaging this amazing fields some
times maybe we just need to fill in those missing slot swiss maybe maybe an average across the drina or something else basically filling in missing fields in your dataset is this whole science to let it depends on how the rest of your day is structured and what that particular field ideas but choosing how to fill in that missing slots is a very advanced topic i'm not to talk about there's this other thing you can do call
normalizing day yes sometimes numbers are wildly different let's say that one feature for example is number of bedrooms were talking about housing costs can be two or three or maybe four where is distance to downtown measured in feet is the new while we hire well those two numbers being point wholly different scales can actually hurt the performance of certain machine learning algorithms say you want to bring them down to the same kind of
scale recall at normalizing see you normalize your features so these are all things that you can do to improve your performance but there is one thing that drastically improved the performance of machine learning our rhythms and that is called regular realization and you're going to learn about regular is asian probably in the first kabul weeks of andrew being were the first couple chapters of any other book i apologize it took me so long to get to
in my pod cassis just so boring and so technical and detail it's like i just wanted to kind of cover the high level stuff before gotten to the nitty gritty some hard understand it's just it's just a technical so it's super super important to to machine learning understanding you can go on without it and so i would estimate you probably know little bit about rivers issue already and if not you'll learn about it when you start diving into the details machine like the irritation it is a step you take to reduce or fitting
and under fading overfishing and ponder fitting or sometimes call high variance and hide by its respectively in machine learning we have variance and by its a machine learning algorithm has any level of variance and by it's the level of variance determines the amount of over fitting a new level of bias determines the amount of ponder fitting and this is what these things mean the best way to
think of this is judging a book by its cover now your machine learning algorithm uribe support back to machinery on iwerks and you're trying to learn whether or not you will enjoy a book by its cover well you read hundred thousand books and you see all their covers and you know which books you've liked and which ones you haven't liked and i think you have a hunch as to what books would be good just looking at its cover now a naive machine lerner will cost you say you can't judge a book by its cover itself
pottery buddy no you can't judge a book by its cover and you tap your nose new say kansai the other allred says no love course you can't and re single book is unique in it's own special way every single book cover represents a specifically different book okay every book has its cover and it's unique there's nothing that connects these things together that's algorithm suffers off rama high variance old worth
fading a case that's a problem that you can have an mushy morning you're on the other hand let's say that you have gotten a little bit over confident you take a look at you look at your fantasy and camillo this book and hyperion seldom looks at it and spit has a bare chested man sitting on a horse and a girl behind him swarming with her hand on her head is a cop come on that's romance with which this fantasy well maybe you were tipped off by the horse and a strong man sitting on it maybe looks like he's right
the battle i don't know the fact of the matter is you guess too fast to fuel the area bulls tipped you off you didn't think hard enough to take up another bout you like fantasy that another guy facie case against anything fancy you my friend suffer from a high of bias that is a wonder fitting under fitting or height bias is when you don't use enough data to make the decision usually this is the result of not having enough data to begin with in the training phase overfed
ng or high a variance means you're too specific you're not generalizing enough you noble even generalization you think it's harmful so if we're looking at linear regression for example linear regression remember was fading a lying to a cloud of data points docks in the shape of a football let's say that the day it is not shaped like a football that's a little bit curvy and we need ideally to come up with a pollen o'neill function maniacs
where are some sort of kirby goes out now not again that so we're hoping for that's an ideal fit good general was a high bias would not have any polio new law issue is bill wine goes right to the center is not using complex enough features by using words not using enough features in general to make his productions is too simple it's productions or two simple high variants or over fitting might fit the line with too many holland o'neill's
might have to meet x. squared simex cubes and exco forth into the fifth what you get is all lying they go through every single point on the graph that's not right either we want something that general lyons's something that reduces the overall error but is as samples we can make it without being biased i think this is all comes razor i'm sure most of you know what bottoms racer is i'm not to define it really empty stomach
summarize it as simplest solution winds now you wanna go to assemble otherwise you have high bias under fitting we will go to complex because any have overfishing higher variants what you want is the simplest equation possible that will give you a generally good algorithm but generally good graf something that's squiggles up and down not really cleanly and subway doesn't touch on all the dots scott i go through the mill mall than the reason for that is
you adding new docks gianni de points it's more likely to get back rights or at least close right then and over fifth graf to the problem with bias and variance the problem with honour fitting in overfishing is that a male while you to make somewhat accurate predictions in the training phase but when you come to the ballet shoes that were the tests that your way to be wrong to leisure both evils variants unbiased and we want to reduce both of these if
possible you wanna come up with a good generalization strategy is neither too complex nor too simple and that is this thing called a regular realization regular edition it is a little chunk they you add to the end of any machine learning how we're them that modifies the equation and by reducing counterfeiting and overfed and it's interesting what would it does for example linear regression is it might reduce the effect of pollen no meals at heart
explain m. leave it to the intruding stuff for you to learn the details of regulars nation but it's basically a little pat on the u. act any new machine learning algorithms that will reduce bias in variants so once again under fitting is jumping the gun basically you have enough data to come up with a good generalizations prodigy and so you come up with an insufficient generalizations strategy video line when what should be used as a whole no mail you pick up a book you make that judgment call
based on true few features of the book in your hands now i do believe that a book can be judged by its cover at least the genre of the book could be judged by its cover but over fading algorithm over here comes along says no book could be judged by its cover every single book is independent this algorithm has does not come up with any sort of generalization strategy they wouldn't be able to tell what genre even the public is looking at because as to specific so the optimal strategy is
i'm sort of middle ground where you can judge some characteristics of a book by its cover not too specific not too simplistic okay so that is performance we talked about performance evaluation and performance improvement things that can work performance thing second her performance would be i'd buy us a hyperion said is under fitting an old were fading respectively non of normalized feature is missing degas too little dana orally to whom to hyper parameters such as number
a new ron's or number of layers and you're all my work and dark and number of ways to improve on any of these issues you to win your hyper parameters or you would feel in your missing degas your normalize york numeric data and you would regular rise you algorithm by adding a little extra algorithm child to the ends realization that would decrease overfishing and under fading away we measure our algorithms performance well the job i'm has its error or loss functional used to measure
to own performance while it's learning don't subjective personal performance metric and in the end of any session we will find retest are algorithm with the tests that this performance evaluation we might use something called accuracy which is a very general simple catchall for measuring performance but in certain edge case in areas we might try to balance precision versus recall precision is how much a straight shooter you are you may all have
we estimate you make verses recall which is how why'd you pasture net do not let any estimates escape you can use m. f. to score to measure the balance of your precision and we call and finally we'll just break our day is set into training and tests that's no we add a third set we break into furry training set validation set and tests that we use our training set to train to learn the fate of parameters
we use our validation set to determine how well or algorithm it is doing it is not doing too well that we might add just hyper parameters human that adjustable parameters of you algorithm and finally the very end we will measure the algorithms overall score by way of the performance evaluation boring i was not one but my friends as i said maybe episode you are now look down at with the basics of machine morning of course per usual encourage you to finish the engine being caught
worse and then from there move on to the deep learning book start putting with python and tanzer flow there are no resources for this episode performance evaluation an improvement is kind of high aid to learning the machine learning algorithms you're going to be exposed to the south but i mention this episode not as an independent module in any learning series but alongside any individual algorithm as you go and starting now all i'm
owing to be moving on into people earning i might break this pie kass now popped into seasons with next season's going to be deep learning which means that i may end up causing a creating new episodes for this pot cast in the short term just to catch up on the deep learning essential so like him so i have in my mind good enough to teach to you guys and and create new season on people earning but that's organized be covering again
next sequence of episodes as far as the eye can see we're going to be moving completely into deep learning sorts kennedy find words are never cardio met works convolution o'neill networks and more eventually ones i've covered all the deep learning material i will move to reinforce no learning i hope to sort of easy to artificial intelligence proper with this pod casts serious bits and take some time actually don't know
enforcement learning myself yet fanatic learn mastiff no background for to teach it in order to pave the way a four deep learning and we inspire you to learning this stuff because it it is beautiful it is magical fascinating algorithms i'm going to do my next episode on consciousness i'm going to talk about what people are talking about thinking about in philosophy incarnate science in neuroscience
along the lines of consciousness and how it may relate to neural networks artificial intelligence and all those things it's going to be a little bit pseudoscience seeing definitively subjective and i know it could ruffle some feathers but i do encourage my rigorously incurable listeners to listen to the episode it'll just be some fine it'll just be a little bit of inspiration i'm not going to try to make any definitive claims one way or another i'm just going to introduce the topic and spiral of
sinners because there is certainly some potential correlates between our official new owner works and biological know mel works if not entirely in an architectural way a potentially in a functional way i think this will be a very fine episode at the end of that episode i will get back you guys as to whether i'm going to break this up and seasons one and two or if i'm just going to continue from their right into deep learning all let you now see you guys next time


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash famine belt chief get time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and teaches conductivity focused and tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that at waseda val dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode sixteen consciousness this is gonna be my favorite episode to make the
said topic near and dear to my heart that concept of artificial consciousness cannot and will artificial intelligence when downright be conscious an extremely controversial topic to be sure and one which will require the definition of consciousness will get into that nugget but before we get into consciousness let's talk about the inspirations that drive people into the field of artificial intelligence we talked about this before in a very early episode
the various inspiration to bring people move field in the past people who were developing in artificial intelligence or probably more specifically machine learning gone to the space because they just want to solve interesting and challenging problems maybe they had at statistics or theoretical computer science p. h. d. n. a. quickly found out what were the best applications of their skills to make big money and to solve challenging problems these are people like that wants to use machine learning on wall street for high frequency trading an ally
things have changed recently the graduating class of twenty seventeen machine mining engineers are brought to the field not so much to saul new and interesting problems for its own right but by way of inspiration we see major things happening in the world right now itself driving cars music poetry and court synthesizing things that we considered impossible by way of artificial told him snug prior generation and we're seeing it happen that day by day in new king crab
all breakthroughs on a monthly basis usually by google also by facebook by two idea i'm open ai always other companies but big stuff is happening so that for the main inspirational drivers are bringing people into the field machine in there seeing this incredible amount of economic automation there were cheating by way of this technology itself driving cars even scientific discoveries drug discovery in creation medical robots x. ray analysis legal proceedings
don by machine moaning like robot judges all the stuff so people are saying that the new wave of jobs is by way of automation and a smart move as a professional is to be at the top and automation engineer one they'll wanna get left in the dust so i wanna make smart special move but to these problems that we're solving by way of ai are incredibly inspiring and powerful things celeste the first inspiration in my mind it's bringing people into the fields trying to stay on top of the economy and being inspired by
things are being created inspiration number two the singularly many have come to this pot cast after being inspired from media books like the singular using year in high korea mine by ray kurzweil tv shows like west for older than black nearer than just the overalls id eyes of this concept called the singularly the scene you larry is this idea that technology is progressing at an exponential released at a poem gnome you
oh case not you win your case as should be expected of technological growth the idea was proposed long ago but champions by a guy named ray kurzweil who wrote a seminal book called the singularly is near mount mind fifteen percent of the expert machine mining engineer or or phd listeners are rolling their eyes and growing at the mere mention of the name breakers while and my seventy five percent of bright eyed and bushy tailed
inspired listeners are sitting up in their chairs in anticipation for both of you i'm actually not going to take a stance one way or another on the credibility of the singular d. i'm just going to describe it my purpose in this park s. episode is consciousness to the idea of the singular eerie is that if we look at the rate at which technology has progressed in human history it here is to fall on something of an exponential or maybe pollen o'neill graf rather than allying we've got an awkward of facing slocum
all the way back to tools then to the agricultural revolution then the industry revolution then at the information age which we presently live in and possibly what comes next being the intelligence explosion by way of artificial intelligence each one of those technological revolutions was more substantial than the prior and closer to the prior then the prior to its prior thus looking like a net exponential or at least pollen o'neill graph the idea goes that's that's
some point on an exponential graf they're curious to be a hard elbow the corner which the graft sort of rockets into space trying it in fig leaf to reach what's called an axe and talked a lot of the graph prior to that point it appears to be increasingly nearly a very normal pace but some point there is an elbow horror shoot up into the sky and we call this the singularly both our technology appears to show the trend of the pollen on your exponential graf and we huh
and hit that elbow yet but we do appear to be increasing in rapid clip what might cause such an elbow well artificial intelligence matters of thinking ai it is the automation above our technology curious all of our technology can be automated potentially by artificial intelligence which is simply defined as automating any mental tasks that's what artificial intelligence bits of course as robotics so according to the singular in some way we may not even be participants in the middle
as technology will the automated well what is an ai not only cool it candle automation of a particular mental and physical task mental by way of ai physical by way of robotics but also influenced its successor by improving upon its own algorithm took either influences celtic either update its own our room to improve the outgrown that we gave it in order to achieve some asian or improve the next generation of such algorithms so that they're better to task
ever is then maybe their task we have at the self improving machine learning algorithm of sultan proving a high and that's what's called seed ai ai they can prove itself once that happens we'll even know what comes next for the sky's the limit so that's a possible candidate for what kicks off the singularly what is said to see larry is highly controversial it's debatable flocks of fun though you can read all about and recruit wiles book the singular he is near and most of the episodes all black near t. v. series
are based on concepts of the singularly so that's another inspirational driver bringing people into the field of artificial intelligence and by the way i keep talking about a high but this is a high caste series about machine learning now my listeners remember from a prior episode that i made the distinction between ai machine running on one make this distinction one more time because we may have new listeners years specifically for this episode on consciousness so let me just define a guy with freddie said it is our male bull mental processing above it
any sort anything that is an automated mental processes theoretically considered artificial intelligence then there's this concept of artificial general intelligence and artificially intelligent agent which can perform all mental tasks or least all mental tasks that humans are capable of and to the level which humans are capable of performing those tests in other words in the k. g. i. a. agent artificial general intelligence is an agent which can do everything humans can do mentally at least as good as humans if not better when it's better we call a super
am i worried as good as humans equality gianni a little less than humans we call a week ai with the specific task in artificial intelligence such as image recognition speech sentences etc it is a specific artificial intelligence task not intended to be applied to everything across the board we call a week and i and if we can apply across the board because strong ai or cagey i know what is machine learning fit to this picture machine learning is a sub field within ai
are many filled with amanda's robotics there's perception is planning knowledge representation all these things and the reason that i'm focusing on machine learning is for two reasons machine learning it is the most accessible field within ai if you wanna crack into the industry professional wait a whole lot of machine learning jobs are opening up all over the place is becoming wildly popular a lot of professional application know why you crack in the industry things like fraud detection image recognition speech said
sisters and see a lot of chap ought to papa not left and right any sort of actionable in sight space on a data collected by companies so so machine learning is the accessible part of the iron it's the way you cracked in today i professionally and also it is increasingly a quart component if not of the court component of that day i was above dedicated spaces with an ai are quickly becoming sub soon the war at least major league contribute to bah
i'm learning we're finding that learning is more than just an aspect of intelligence it may be one of the most important if not the most important aspect of intelligence so if you're interested in ai anyone involved star with this potash series is very introductory star from the very beginning worked his way out okay so to inspirations all three driving people into the space of artificial intelligence by way of machine learning the first being economic automation
is in their best interest professionally to be at the top when this major economic revolution at lansdowne horgan near future i will find myself that this position i do think being and automation engineers say why is career choice the second inspirational little bit more controversial being missing hilarity if you believe in the singular he then you can be a participant in this exponential explosion of technological advancements by being a machine mining engineer i'm not going to stay
whether or not i believe in the scene you larry because i want to save my credibility destruction before the next inspiration the third inspiration driving people to the space marshall intelligence and that is consciousness artificial consciousness can robots be conscious this is a very important question because of robots can be conscious if we can say that their conscience and we say they have a mind if they have a mind they have a full eight
soul all three things are synonymous consciousness soul and mind and that is a very very important assertion indeed that has major implications with religion with carter science and everything if we can be convinced that a robot's is conscious then my friends everything changes life as we know it changes this is indeed the inspirational driving force that led me to studying machine learning
is what brought me into the fields out in this contest that so i'm going to do my best to not make an opinion and to not a fine myself with any theories that are presented in the space of consciousness i just want to personal able and i want you to explore making your own decision not to be able to make an opinion just from this broadcast episode but in the resources that i'd give you you'll be able to continue exploring representing ms episode and eventually come up with your own conclusion one thing i'd do you wanna say
is a lot of times when this topic is brought up in the space these from mckinley jerks come around and they say we don't know waving about consciousness we can even talk about it nobody in the space can even agree on a definition hate when that happens is just not true honestly when people come at me with that report it shows that they lack understanding about consciousness and therefore there is no understanding about consciousness see me wanna be careful bring up the topic some of the stuff you learn intercepts
no because you will find people get really upset really angry that is for shoot down the conversation and say stop talking about it shut up shut out the closer years may just do not wanna talk about consciousness there's two reasons that you'll see people respond this way one is that people leave that the topic of consciousness as all this government did call the heart problem of consciousness is not something you can even talk about because it is definitively subjective another reason people get upset is that they think that we as a machine mining engineers artificial intelligence people center
or not neuroscientist score not neural physiologist says cetera and therefore we cannot participate in such a controversial scientific topic you'll see that this is not true artificial intelligence is a subspace of cognitive science the machine learning is a subspace of artificial intelligence and therefore we are indeed curtis up into the table of the conversation consciousness we are board members of this company additionally this stuff is inspirational if we gained called conversations of consciousness science fiction
we're pseudoscience which i believe they're not i think they're legitimate conversations that doesn't affect my desire to explore the topic at all it's science fiction and pseudoscience inspires some of the greatest minds like you on mosque to explore and achieve the impossible we as humans are capable of achieving so much greatness if we believe in the impossible and we apply ourselves a lot times that inspiration comes from the science fiction a society topics like stay
it's exploration sending people to mars and yes artificial consciousness so don't listen to these nay sayers for one we can prove them wrong by achieving the impossible ever to they're simply wrong about statements like nobody knows anything about consciousness know in the space to agree upon the definition of buffeting so how can we ever hope to talk about such that is wrong that is pure wrong there's a lot about consciousness about us definition that is disagree upon
from one expert to the next but there's a lot it is agreed upon a lot of agreements in cognitive finds solace talk about some definitions let's talk about cognitive sciences first card of science clogs i'd is an umbrella term for all of these sort of ballerina sciences that includes psychology neuro physiology neuroscience computational neuroscience neuro biology so those are all those hard sciences about the brain it also includes full
sophie at least the branch of philosophy concerned with the minds now doesn't quite concerns of the wane as such because that stuff is covered by the brain science is that our bridges of philosophy which concern themselves with a mind and as i mentioned already also includes artificial intelligence very importantly it includes artificial intelligence because my friends artificial intelligence was not computer science first we didn't start by making a bunch of algorithms
i'm saying holy cow this time it looks like a brain what's called the neural network that would be disingenuous indeed if that was how we went about it no major names in the region nation of things in neural networks such as the creation of the perception on our frank rosenblatt warren mcculloch and walter pits these guys are respectively were neural biologist neuro physiologist and computational neuroscientist so these were playing guys and they wanted
come up with a mathematical representation of what they were seeing it in the brain and they came up with the perception on later to be calm the artificial neural network the day and and came fromm bilby n. n. at the biological neo my work to artificial intelligence was a spinoff of brain science therefore we're allowed a seats in the cognitive science board of directors within coggin of science these various fields there is a agreements and disagreements about what constitutes consciousness
so what kinds of things to be agree with and disagree with well for one we know approaches definition of consciousness a consciousness by a comparison to the intelligence so we have two things that come out of the brain intelligence which is simply the capacity to compute to perform a mental task every human is prospectively intelligent maybe intelligence comes in scale some humans are smarter than other humans humans generally are more intelligence than the lower speed
he's down to a fish all the way down to a snail to intelligence seems to come in scale sales are intelligent just less intelligent than humans intelligence is the capacity to compute information processing capacity maybe will call it as such we have no problem calling artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is replicated intelligence and computer form and it is indeed intelligent it is simply computing information processing information doing now thinking it's head then
separate from intelligence is the only other thing which is consciousness mind the soul so we agree upon that distinction amongst the various fields and cognitive sciences know one of this consciousness well that's where things beloved dicey consciousness is many things to many people must go through some of the aspects of consciousness which may or may not be controversial within the field of god of science perception that appears to be an essential component of consciousness will start there just to work our way up to figure what
receptionists not consciousness well it's maybe an aspect of consciousness baby a prerequisite for consciousness will see perception is your ability to see things you're things touch things are a five senses in humans other biological species half your senses maybe others have more maybe a robot could have more than humans there is thoughts of that perception is a requirement for thinking okay some people say no we don't need perception to think you can live without perception bring in a
act they call it you can think math we have the architecture in our brains to de dukes to come up with mathematical equations for philosophical sludge isms all these in general or coal production by contrast to induction which is learning by experience warning that touching the hot countertop burns your hands some philosophers think that wall we have at the architecture for deduction built and for brains naturally we cannot take it into process without fer
inducing something without first experiencing something by way of inaction on which to de duke's so the idea goes that if you see one cop another cop and another cop you can come up with the concept three you can come up with the concept two plus one and two minus one and all those things but if you've never seen items in the world in some cannibal capacity before would you ever be able to perform arithmetic in your mind as controversial some say yes some say no let's move on her
section may or may not be essential characteristics of consciousness how about self identity ha there's a more controversial topic i think you'll find when you're talking to your friends and family about consciousness and you say it can you define it for me this is probably the most common of definition you'll get all the meat pies in the equation consciousness does need be able to self reflect self reflection self identity comes i'm not so convinced
that equals consciousness personally at the very least nine maybe even say that it's not even an essential characteristic of consciousness will get to that in a bit but you can imagine for the sake of argument that self identity self awareness may just be almost an evolutionary add on to consciousness there's a theory goes if you have a fury of self self identity you can adjust your actions in accordance with your fury of self
your theory itself may be a simulation of help others see you soon intelligent minds will learn what things to do and not to do in an environment don't touch hot stove to eat the food will take that up a notch and learn about ourselves about who we are in an environment and we can learn how to adjust properties on ourselves so as to better get on with those around us this theory
self identity says basically the self identity is nothing more than running theory of how others see you so that you can make proper adjustments to get along with people not having a solid self identity means making enemies and maybe getting killed having a strong self identity enough to improve upon that algorithm means making friends allies and having sacks of course not everybody agrees upon us some people think indeed that self identity is a core component
consciousness but one more retort to that concept is the idea that certain lower species seemed to lack self identity is unclear the dogs are word themselves for example for higher species appear to have self identity like chimps we've got certain tests for testing whether they exhibit self reflection things like they can put a dock on animals had an unhappy animal look itself near death and elephant reaches it's trunk towards the mirror versus towards its own head and then we think maybe ago
and exhibit self identity certain animals pass this test are mammals fail we'll other such tests for self identity the tests themselves or even controversial the point i'm trying to make is some animals house itself identity and some don't know say your dog doesn't would you say your dogs not conscious do you indeed personally think that your dog has nothing rattling not there simply a mechanical computing device and it's just as reactionary
biological organism that isn't experiencing the world around and i don't think you do i think if you sat with this for a while you would come to the conclusion that most if not all biological organisms are conscious enough fundamental way even whacking self identity so self identity appears to be a very controversial component contributor to the definition of consciousness but indeed in an important modify we do hope that if we can achieve our official consciousness eventually there will
how self identity so the very least self identity is a powerful module at the very least it's a powerful contributor to high steel consciousness but is unclear whether it is a necessary component of consciousness definitively by the way my own personal opinion is this if we go with the theory that self identity is what you were running simulation of self so that you can prove yourself an environment does that sound familiar to something we've mentioned to you know
episode to me that sounds like seed ai in my personal opinion the moment we build self identity into machine learning algorithms effectively and powerful a. is the moment everything begins seed ai recall is an artificial intelligence agents able to improve upon its own algorithm another word for this is actually a medal learning and is indeed a hot topic in the space a machine learning going on right now lots of companies are
exploring machine learning algorithms capability to improve on themselves okay a few other aspects of consciousness when we're talking about it's our memory and learning now these go hand in hand you can learn without memory and by the way you can have self identity without learning and memory now nobody would say that learning and memory or consciousness but these are things we may agree upon as essential to the grand picture we need these things in place to get there so we've talked about
sections self reflection of memory and learning we're not quite there yet is something missing is something something feels not quite right about we we've been talking about consciousness with these rock components that they don't really get always there is one thing we haven't mentioned one thing that in my opinion all the cognitive scientist agree upon as essential to the equation of consciousness if not the very definition of consciousness itself
it is awareness awareness or sentence subjective experience quality of these are all words for the same theme which is the lights are on something it is on up there okay you as a human when you see in you hear things you're the dog barking a nice enough why are you not just some information passing device that crunches that perception internally but that that perception is never experienced know you hate spear
inside the c. the hearing of the dog bark when in your ear and some little here's near your stimulated and some electrical firings happened within the brain within your biological neural networks neuro transmitters are transferred from attacks on to dan's right chemicals are thrown left and right electricity goes all for your brain but none of that explains the fact that you heard the dog the dog's bark was heard by you us
objective experiences you cannot explain it here is to exist in a different dimension and that is why we call of the mind or the soul the heart problem of consciousness will talk about a bit awareness it's hard to define me you know exactly what i'm talking about yea a fairly maybe we can define consciousness explicitly as awareness of the lights are on the one people say nobody can come over
the definition of consciousness so we can even talk about it well we can all agree that awareness is not very definition of consciousness itself is at least a claw or fundamental component consciousness and my friends if something could convince you that it exhibits awareness which you not agree that is conscious that is the reason we believe our dogs are conscious they up here to exhibit to you that they're aware inside the something is going on at the lights are on notice won
things suspiciously missing by him many people's definition many laypeople i dare say and that is emotion interesting to many people will say will be well i can never be conscious because it can never no longer can ever know sadness it never know pain and sorrow in los happiness joy ate all those things to some people the motion appears to be an essential characteristics of consciousness in my opinion and this is my own personal opinion i'm not going to find myself the camps
part of science they go one way or another on this topic i think a motion is not even a characteristic of consciousness i think it is an accidental drop then of evolution a reinforcement learning a mechanism things that make us happy stimulate some positive reinforcement mechanism to make us what do that again in the future and things that make us on a happy are some negative reinforcement mechanisms that make us want to avoid such actions in the future in other words ammo
fans are nothing more than a computational mechanism for seeking up or avoiding certain activities for our own survival sake i think about all the things it emotional about sex and love physical pain losing someone death these are all things that have evolutionary explanations in fact will talk about how o. possibly an artificial intelligence agents quid experience emotion on some level maybe not the way he
and experience and that possibly experience pain and pleasure no less real we than we do we'll get to that nugget so we come upon something that most cognitive scientists can agree upon and that is that the very definition or at least decor component consciousness is awareness that is subjective experience another thing that they agree upon it is this distinction between what's called the soft problem of consciousness and a heart problem of consciousness the soft problems of concha
snaps are basically things we know so it's always gonna be a moving target or running definition things that we know through the hard sciences we know for instance the consciousness comes from the brain it clearly comes from the physical brain the brain is the biological substrate of the mind is what they say that sack hatch phrase the brain is the biological substrate of the mind we know that we've known that for long time we've known it since at least the renaissance we know it's substantially more accurate
we these days than we did in the past we have things like them are rising cat scans and cat scans we can look at the brain and cigarettes specifically which regions are firing when we asked a patient a question think about your mother or plan some activity we have to wit heed the centers of the brain associated with what specific mental processes be to look under a microscope and we can see the activity of an you're on exactly why and where mental activity calm
swim know the speeches and broke is area that planning is not free from all cortex so the soft problems of consciousness or the things we know the things of science the heart problem is but why a consciousness okay if little bit difficult to explain but on the one hand we have this physical world wherein we can observe the blame for m. r.

's microscopes any other hand we have this other dimension the spiritual world this matheson
old world above the mind your own subjective experience it seems that your subjective experience when you're thinking we're doing math are planning something we're daydreaming especially daydreaming is a good example appears to be a different dimension of course this is what gave rise i'm sure the bully for life after death and religion that your soul lives on pasture body because they appear to exist in different planes and different dimensions on this heart problem is how
all how's that possible is a paradox this paradox is made manifest by the concept of dualism tanaka get too much in the history of the exploration of consciousness but i will mention one thing that is the concept of dualism put forth by rene descartes when a car was one of the biggest mines in the early exploration of consciousness was fascinated with the topic rene descartes is on the mind behind i think therefore i am an evil genius that gave way to the matrix okay how can we
oh we're not in the dream rather than the real world all aesthetic and see how that all plays into consciousness he was obsessed with topic the concept of dualism is this very concept that the minds and the brain it exists in different dimensions now it's a paradox how could they possibly exist in different dimensions if they exist in different mentioned is the mind is something known physical foaming metaphysical then how could possibly interact with the brain which is something physical at some
point the mine would have to become visible to enter the physical world to stimulate the brain into action but that's just paradoxical at what point cannon on physical thing become visible it just doesn't make sense descartes believe that this seat of the mind in the brain was the peel glands where he came up with this why is that a lot of structures number wayne have a mirror image on the other hemisphere so we have one thing on the left hemisphere and the mirror on the right hemisphere and you're a big structures
well that okay neal gland was this tiny little structure that didn't happen your image so it physically looked like a good candidate for laptop log and out what were you plug in the mind from the other universe but he couldn't defeat that conundrum how can the non physical become visible and so scientists just don't believe in dualism these days anymore dualism is relegated to religion nests people who believe in life after death and so if you are religious now waiting you probably are the less but many today go
we've that's the mind is physical somehow somehow the marini comes from the brain the brain and does the stuff in the mind comes out of that but how it is a mystery is a mystery wanted the last remaining mysteries of the universe we can manipulate the brain and alter the minute we know through certain patients in case studies that alterations to the brain in repeatable fashion calls alterations to the mind thirty's case studies late fee
is the jew had a railroad spike driven through his brain in cars specific alterations to his personality okay people even dualism and that that camille gland is this sort of an outlet wearable mine plugs in one how those sizzled image was specific other chunk of your brain has nothing to appeal gland substantially and terminally a factor personality which is an aspect of your minds just doesn't work that way to see brain and cases leading to mine the cases in re
pupil and unpredictable fashion we know they're too wet to lead to high but how does a mind to come out of that the reason we asked that is because we wanna know if we could perfectly replicate in robot they bring like structure which then have a mind so knowing how old the mind comes out of the brain is what's called the heart problem of consciousness and it's basically nothing more than a paradox command from some people think that we can never know how the mind comes out of the plane because
mind is definitively it's subjective it experience consciousness is awareness awareness is subjective experience i know in my mind what's going on you can observe my brain in an m. r. i. a. b. you can ever observe what's actually happening in my mind you can guess who i'm thinking about was specific actions i'm planning you can see certain centers firing but my experience is definitively subjective similarly and i can see what any of you guys are thinking nor can i even be certain that you all
are by all indications your minds must think the way my mind does as a result of my brain firing than yours does similarly i must conclude that you were similarly have consciousness that you are aware but i can prove it because your experiences are definitively subjective so something that the brain mind problem heart problem of consciousness is definitively on scientific on knoll and all we could do is get us all we can do is take it on faith that say
isn't that here are two how the consciousness house consciousness this is basically the idea of deterring test alan turing was one of four fathers of the computing revolution is a big believer of artificial intelligence he was very fascinated in space of our official consciousness and he came up with a test called the charring test and he made it sound so complex and convoluted and all it says there's a lot about farsighted out at the back is the thing that can convince you that it is
conscious then it is conscious we have no way of exploring howl in one way it's conscious so all we can do is take it on faith that if they can convince you that conscious then it's conscious that sputtering tax there's another idea which says that we may eventually be able to observe this stuff actually the connection between the brain and the mind how the mind comes from the brain if you think about it the mind is madge
it too last right now and that's why in the mind that kkk this whole episode inextricably tied with religious fox the idea that the full lives on after the body dies it's magic well we've seen this before in science we've seen things that were previously magic be calm science for example we used to think that sickness illness was evil spiritual infestation or a curse of god and we later found out it was back to
ray and viruses these were just theoretical bacteria and viruses they were observed directly under the microscope which at magic when a science and in a similar way that we recently been able to really hands-on can observe this theoretical concept of gravity we've been able to sort of interact with it and observe it physically perhaps we can calm to see the mind through science is unclear if will come to that point but it is possible i heard one sam
idea that philosophy is basically a moving a caravan of fingers a bunch of settlers moving westward constantly thinking about how the universe works thinking about all the puzzle settled there when something becomes observable experimental test of all outcomes of branch of those philosophers to settle a colony of some new colony over here a hard at science it's a cold neural physiology psychology and the like
but that philosophy keeps traveling west work ever in search of the infinity of mystery is to the edges that philosophy is ever at the front here thinking about stuff we don't know at any time we come to know what outcomes of science science is branched off of philosophy comes out both philosophy settle the colony and sits with its lat well perhaps as we've done in the past where we've created science for magic
philosophy pushing ever west words into the mysteries of consciousness will find something that will stay there will actually be able to make science of this mystery this heart problem of consciousness so those are two takes on this concept one is that gave you we haven't gotten there yet with the science and the other is maybe it is not signs of old maybe it is purely and definitively a subjective thing the heart problem of consciousness so let's talk a little
and about some ideas rattling around the space of philosophy and cognitive science an artificial intelligence about we're conscious this comes from theories within the heart problem of consciousness remember this is called a heart problem for reason we can get observe how the mind is created from the brain and so we haven't spaces lot of guesswork one of the most compelling ideas in my opinion out there is something called the merchants emergence the idea that dumb
i mean this simply emerge and property of the brain that cures to be the case we have the brain it's firing it's doing some stuff come to some numbers planning some actions the unpredictable and repeatable an observer always an outcome the mind perhaps that mind doesn't exist in a different dimension they're not two separate things as dualism holes but the minute it is the byproduct of the brain the brain is the thing is doing the thinking in the mind is simply
the experience of that in other words one f thinking is simply experienced they are the exact same thing this is compelling we know that intelligence coms in scale by human is more intelligent than a snail but snail is still intelligence we all accept that sales to humans everything in between our intelligence in their own way because they're thinking machines are computing device is navigating their way through their environments will perhaps
consciousness is simply the experience of intelligence intelligence is the thinking the brain is the device on which the thinking occurs in consciousness is the experience of that thinking is experienced in fact the case we would say that humans are more conscious than sales because intelligence in consciousness are basically the exact same thing we just think of them differently intelligence is the capacity in the action and consciousness is what comes of it now
it makes sense we said that humans are conscious we all agree with that we asked whether our pets are conscious our dogs and cats conscious well we said yes it appears to be so their lights are on at least well of cats and dogs are conscious of what our rats what about fish house nails no word on snails well okay to say that one thing is conscious and not the other where did you draw the line and why we don't seem to have from neuroscience some definitive center of the brain without which we say
you there is no consciousness and biological organism like i said this is a heart problem sorted pure arbitrary where and how you draw the line between species which are aware of what's happening in their environments experiencing a quality of subjective experience and those which don't so consciousness cons and scale is directly tied to intelligence says one school of thought out there asap field within that this emergence property theory is something called the computational theory of mine too
and it says well if consciousness is an emergent property of intelligence in humans and dogs and snails well what is it that these things have in common there are information processing systems within their brains we're computing the stuff that happens around us using our intelligence architectures if that's the case then wouldn't any information processing system any computational device experience consciousness as well off now we're getting into artificial consciousness
computational theory of mine to the c. t. m. holds that the consciousness is the emergence property of computing computing we've defined intelligence we've tied it to humans and snails and that robots we said that consciousness maybe the byproduct of intelligence in a merchant property the experience of intelligence we agreed that artificial intelligence by it's very name does indeed exhibit intelligence
and therefore after all that artificial intelligence shorty indeed thereby exhibit consciousness as emergent property of its own intelligence again everything in scale the idea is humans are extremely intelligent and extremely conscience as far as we can tell by comparison to other lesser of biological species but let me be the case as well with artificial intelligence perhaps ai is extremely intelligent in it's own week way in specific over
polls ai is better at image recognition than we are in some cases certainly ai is better at math and really hard computational stuff than humans but there are many aspects in which they ideas less intelligent than humans in that regard perhaps a giant experiences consciousness it's over coals and which it's very effective so for example perhaps experiences very highly lucid visual experience
perhaps by the c. t. m. ai when it sees a thing with its convolution own works and such experiences seeing an extremely loose incapacity better than humans but in the areas were false shorts which are many it is less conscious many humans and certainly am i present relax self identity so it doesn't appear that ai is yet in our playing field but it may according to the c. t. m. at least be all we're experiencing this
insisted are happening consciousness and scale because intelligence is in scales to consciousness is the same as intelligence just thought of different way one example of the city she discovered keeping your head it once we start moving forward these episodes is this thing called word to vet word to that is a component of language modeling in natural language processing solo stuff about language read it to it's like chaff box and ca
defying tax as being about this or that swore sentiment analysis figuring out if what someone said it was emotionally happy or sad or map reading as new language falls under the category of natural language processing and these models that we use in that space or call language models one of the pieces of all that's his cold war two vet can work to that is basically an ai is vocabulary no word to that is very fascinating
because what it does is it's the war of words in vector space so imagine three space of all these dots all over the place like stars in the galaxy and each word is represented by a dot and through a complex algorithm that wanted to if you drop us a dots or placed near other dots based on their word similarity so if you wanted to come up with a similar were like a thesaurus you wanted to build a thesaurus out of work to that call you gotta do is land
near your doctor and take any of the ones nearby and you have all the related words were to bank has some really cool properties that you can actually do word math you say queen plus keen minus manic equals and outcomes wallman is really cool stuff well if all of that computational machinery yields a highly accurate vocabulary system that can while less than a caucus on its capacity for understanding words then whose
say that that understanding isn't just a mechanical system but experienced understanding exactly you the way we think of the word understanding who's to say that ai it doesn't exhibit understanding already in things like quarterback okay computational theory of mine i'm again i'm not finding myself with any theories floating around about heart problems of consciousness i just want to sort of bringing down all label
lance to get you into sin spires need to start exploring the stuff on your own one more idea of branch of the computational theory of mine is called the integrated information theory i i ate he i liked he says that's effectively all weirdness or at least see woody awareness comes fromm accuracy of the information contained within the idea is that if you have a machine learning model computing in computing in computing initially all the
waiter random they're all over the place the model doesn't understand the picture it's like static on a tv and the more you train it was supervise learning for example a maury training training and trade it's more accurate an actor inaccurate and that awareness is basically the level of accuracy in the system the level to which the system accurately represents something the lack of which is called and for pizza that's the crux of the integrated information theory is that entropy exists in information systems
according to information theory is that the whole plan to met it's called information theory and most of information theory seeds directly into machine learning for training our models and when you were relaying information or trying to come up with a accurate model of something entropy or chaos basically is howl in accurate your system it's something has high entropy an intern in to guess whether things are capper human then it to go either way space we're flipping a coin fifty fifty had no idea the more you do
greece and turkey the more accurate your model pecans and you can go back to him in that the cat as c. n. human human cats had given him a cat perfect score good job machine running model low entropy means high accuracy and i i'd see says basically that awareness this crux of consciousness we've been talking about calms fromm reduced entropy scott an interesting idea it's kind of like if you think about dreaming for example where or what more do we mean we're here to how the ole ole ole we're in
yes in fact we use dreams to make comparisons to consciousness and on consciousness we think that we're kind of conscious in a dream yeah but not saying consciousness that we exhibit in waking life well in our dreams up here is that the information being processed is in some chaotic fashioned high entropy there's lots of theories of what's happening in dreams why we dream something that we're basically practicing a bunch of spins on things we've seen in life the base
a machine learning about this know how bout that note we're like trying up lunch of different light predictions from the day that we experience and doing great in dissent allowing ourselves to think outside of the box in order to improve the accuracy of our productions the i. t. says that the dreams high entropy low awareness look the waking life low entropy high awareness who knows a lot we don't know about dreams it could be that we have our memory white when we wake up could be that
our attention mechanism is out of whack tension is seems to be a core component of consciousness by the way some people really don't like the computational theory of mine or the emergent property stuff because they say well look here's a big difference potentially between the brain of the human brain and pewter bring a computer x. determine as thickly in hasta do with whole based on him with a keyboard or running a program where reason women registers deaths completely determine its degree where humans have free will
free will we can do what we want a very interesting point my friends free will you say you'll really like the tv series west world west world explores the level to which free will defines consciousness we are not home free with that statement free will is believed by many to be a non existence is our own brains or biological structures built on cells which
built on chemistry which are built on physics etc their own brains are completely subject to the laws of the universe as well presumably our brains act exactly in accordance with our environment proof of this is a better brace earth acted by chemicals drugs the things we eat our exercise regimen that all affects depression our own personalities are called sure where we live defines our personalities were families are the people we surround ourselves with brain
damage studies like this thing now is talking about with the news gauge getting a spike through his brain and altering his personality the alteration to his personality is well known by neural physiologist stay they know exactly why and how that aspect of his personality change based on the part of the brain that was affected if our brains are so physically and biologically and chemically determines how could you possibly say that we have free will we indeed our subjects
to the laws of the universe of the brain that is subject to laws of the universe and if we believe that the mind comes out of the brain and not the other way around aka dualism then you must believe that the mind is subject to the laws of the universe indeed and if you believe that then you do not believe that humans have free will of course we still need a word for choice and decision that prefer not cortex of our brain kendall's action planning inaction planning happen
it's so decisions are made but many think that the magic is not there the magic of free will do you think is there that makes a special and a daily el ball from artificial intelligence does not exist in the way you think that you like the topic of free will how it relates to conscious are highly recommended t. v. series wes world's lots of fun okay let's switch gears a little bit we're talking about the c. t. m. an emergency the idea that the mind is simply a necessary byproduct of the brain that any computation
all the vice any complex computational device would thereby exhibit awareness at the very least unconsciousness depending on how you define it now if you sit with this forbid you say okay humans are conscious maybe doctor klein just maybe artificial intelligence is conscious of how low do we go organs a fish is conscious recess knows conscious armies a calculator is conscious a calculator you just said any computational the vice now according to the c. t. m. yes yes the calculator
respectively experiences a flash of awareness of the thing that gets calculates don't remember everything in scale intelligence in scale we have humans are more intelligent as nails humans are more conscious than snails by this idea the c. t. m. according to the c. t. m. then will it help leo doesn't have memory doesn't have self identity it doesn't have attention it doesn't have perception at lax soul very much of what makes high scale consciousness heist
no consciousness but according to the c. t. m. the only thing that matters is awareness week on jan one plus one and we hit the goals the budget connotation happened registers or turn on off its reflect from zero one and potentially according to c. t. m. that flash of one plus one is experienced and he goes away a very interesting idea indeed not the most widely held lots of ideas one round less which years now we have the c. t. m. saying that the mind is unnecessary byproduct of annie computing device a different theory holds
that may be the summit is greater than the parts of the human brain or least biological brains the way even your wrongs overworked specifically in your old physiology and neuroscience in mammals and reptiles and fish and such maybe there's something special to that the summit where the parts perhaps the brain must be just sell in order to get consciousness and we don't know how or why but possibly you have to have new
aunts were least something very similar if this is the case then in order to achieve artificial consciousness we would need to approximate biological brains it's called biological plausibility the phrase a biological plausibility means how close does an artificial thing represent it's biological counterpart so for example a plane can be thought of as something of a functional approximation to a bird
it's wholly different hubbard has feathered flopping means in its tiny and cute and a plane is a giant metal thing was stationary wings propellers and wheels it doesn't biologically approximate the burden to achieve the flights therefore it is not very biologically plausible biological plausibility however it functionally approximates the burden in that it flies able to achieve flights now let's turn to neurons we have you
and brain and it's neurons which biologically and functionally create intelligence and consciousness we have artificial intelligence which functionally creates intelligence now the question is whether it can functionally create consciousness we explored the c. t. m. ballots explorer or biological plausibility in the artificial intelligence a popular and powerful technique employee is called people earning which we're going to be exploring in the next set
of episodes in this pod cast deep learning is based on a functional approximation of the human biological muir on what they said in the beginning of this episode the creators of the artificial miron came fromm the heart of brain science as they were trying to come up with a mathematical representation of the human you're on a mathematical approximation and they came up with the perception on the perception on became eventually the artificial neuron and the artificial neural net
work on artificial neural network we have used to great success in a wide variety of fields is given us the screen flexibility in performing mental tasks in machine learning in artificial intelligence the level of flexibility and accuracy pirate machine running algorithms have not given us what's more is that we have had to tweak the artificial neural network to create dedicated architectures for particular tasks we created
a recurrent neural network for achieving natural language processing tasks the record neural network a convolution only all my work for a vision based tasks a deep kuna work for planning and so on so we have this sort of master algorithm of the artificial mule mel work and in weeks weekend over here for language or therefore vision over here for planning etc at first that here is to take away from the magic of the neural network but if you look at the brain
and that's how the brain does it the brain has the center for speech call broke as an area of center for vision called the primary visual cortex the center for planning called the peripheral cortex and so on their structures there architectures and sometimes even their new ron's or tweaked your q. optimize performance of their particular tasks so we're starting to see you little bit of biological plausibility we saw some level biological plaza believe that
the neural network itself came out both sides of the brain the perception was a mathematical model of the biological me on and we further advance the architectures all of a neural networks can work to achieve specialized capacities which looking back seems to biologically approximate human brain as well so we seemed to be achieving decent biological plausibility so according to the fierce to say the sun is greater than the parts we may be addressing them
with what we already have indeed learning now that may not necessarily be sell the human you're on of course is biological and chemical we have neuro transmitters being transferred from acts on to again fright whereas in an artificial know my work that's not how things work additional eight it appears that neurons in human brain seemed to fire fire fire fire but continuous level of chemical interaction where's neurons an artificial know my work are one shot feed for more importantly there save
very big hedge to the biological plausibility of artificial millman works compared to biological know my works and that is that while a artificial neural network when diagrammed on that piece of paper when a symbolically represented in the mind's eye looks like a biological neuro my work that is not how it looks inside the computer the algorithms and davis structure is associated with an artificial mailman work or stored in ram
as registers over here in ones and zeros reflect and bitter change in variables are altered and things are crumble hard drive and things are taken off the hard drive and it does not look like a neural network when put on the top computer represented the mentally ill on a piece of paper or chalk board in your mind we're lookin' at artificial me all my work represented physically our computer we're working with a computer's architecture nothing at all like a neural my work so that defeats biological plaza bill
a biological plausibility is not helping us here if we believe that sounds great are the parts so there's a minus one for artificial consciousness if you believe in the importance of biological was a building over many do not believe in the importance of biological plaza believe instead they believe in functional isn't as i said a plane and functionally approximates a bird in that he achieves flight well can a artificially on a work function only approximates a biological know my work here
that gets that she's intelligence well already yes we know that it does to do so in order to achieve consciousness that's the big question the heart problem so there we house biological plausibility and function was on those two were sort of head to head competing theories within our official consciousness one of the main proponents of the necessity of biological plausibility is a man named john sir all and see my friends you'll hear his name as you
dive into the world of our official consciousness he is a hater a hater of artificial consciousness they disbelieve are for everybody that believes that we can create artificial consciousness he is there any hit on the one hand you have re kurzweil who's a true believer in on the other hand you have john stroke was a true disbelieve or his main argument is called the chinese room argument that it goes like this you have a man who speaks english who does not speak chinese and he's inside
but the room in the room has a book on a counter of instructions on how to translate surgeries symbols to other chinese symbols this chinese symbol of the place the records as summary slides a chinese symbol under the door and he walks over the door in accepting it looks at you looks around he's trying to his bearings you what the heck the money goes over the instruction book and he okay so i wrote a chance so you influx of pages of sully finds the thing in his hands and okay so this xinhua
surround room that instruction book says that this symbol translates to some other set of samples apparently some is asking a question and we can contract an answer and there's a map i'm acting in this instruction manual so he goes over the korean instruction manual member of this this in the other cards and you look someone's left hand he looks up once in his right hand is not so yes those special instructions say that you walked over the door he slips the three chords ages picked up under the door
and he answered that the chinese question correctly is the chinese room the man understands english is not understand chinese however following instructions he is able to speak chinese it up years however we know that he does not speak chinese man in the room is not speak chinese he's simply following instructions so this is sort of the argument that following instructions it does not yield understanding does not
old consciousness now back to honor argumentative chinese room is that the man that does not understand chinese true love the room what does the system of dies the man is simply a cog in that system the idea here is that a new ron does not understand language but the whole broke this area a cluster of neurons is a system guys i make goes back and forth you're starting to see that there's a huge debate in cognitive science going on between people
the left side people on the right side people to believe that we can synthesize consciousness artificially and people who believe that that is impossible to do so if talk about biological cause a billion we've talked about functional isn't how those go head to head one more point on the topic of function was a big deal functional ism is that if the thing functionally it she's it's gold then it doesn't matter what happens on the hood doesn't have to have biological plausibility if a plane flies it doesn't need feather wings if the machine is conscious
then it doesn't need biological neurons but that's sort of the question reverse how do we prove the machine is conscious we just hands so we rely on things like deterring tasks there's this whole conversation round zombies in open debate of artificial consciousness imagine we have a bunch of zombies in the world urges you know brazen there are walking with their hands out now add glance right away you think there are not conscious of casey turned como or the transfer just now
there there's there's nothing there and this is sort of be on the biologic plausibility side people saying well what about what about zombies animal functional isn't side is if the zombies appear to be exhibiting intelligent behavior imagine them not to sing brains walking round up of their actually conversing with u. etc the function was say that there is no such thing as a mindless zombie if you have something that is exhibiting intelligent behavior it necessarily is intelligent
and necessarily is conscious okay okay there's a lot stuff this is a guy just dumped on you call lot of credit thoughts and theories in the space the point is that there's a big conversation happening right now the big conversation is especially begin hot right now because look what we're doing in artificial intelligence look we're making big things are happening over in google in facebook i. b. m. and by two etc big things are happening
in those bring big questions we have the human brain we can look at the activity in the brain the electrical pulses through with the centers of the brain under an m. r. iraq pet scan our cat scan we can look at the centers are activated the purity associated with conscious box with awareness we can boil consciousness down definitively twiddle least awareness and possibly a depending on the many other aspects such as memory learning self identity attention perception it
cetera and we know that all this comes from the brain but were vexed with this conundrum with the brain is over here creating a minute to minute years to be outside of the physical dimension how can we possibly think about the minds in such a way that we can answer the question of whether artificial consciousness is possible with it is possible to synthesize consciousness through our endeavors in artificial intelligence it's an unsolved mysteries in and settled the bait car
and if scientists are debating to and fro left and right you see this cloud of fists as people are fighting effect actually there's these two cognitive scientist philosophers in particular that just he'd show there it's really fun to watch daniel janet and david chalmers david chalmers is actually we get coined the term the heart problem of consciousness and daniel than it is a very very good author about all things consciousness but that these two are just like a name call each other they fly in the heck out of the choices that big fight
going on in space the current size like this said earlier in the episode we have seats at the table of this discussion that's why this is so fond that's why i'm so interested in machine in an artificial to others that we can participate in the conversation about whether or not is possible synthesize consciousness and if we can synthesize conscious my friends we can create the soul of this is prospectively the most important thing that humanity has ever done has ever accomplished and i believe that part
shh lentil engines and junior's machine learning engineers and that sort might be the missing piece to understandings equation one of the most lasting quotes that his stock with me was between these two bears the date about artificial consciousness myers will those guys who says the site is something you can talk about codified to skinny you agree upon the definition just let him go and he said look look here's what consciousness is consciousness is a camera looking at s. c.
e. we have cones and cubes and spheres and we can dissect them we can do all the science and math to understand the scene that were observing weekend science the heck out of the room that the one thing we cannot science the heck out of his ourself why because we're a camera we're looking at the scene and we cannot look at our self consciousness is definitively subjective outside the realm of science him
possible to make objective in some guy in the debate said young masiello mirror he smiled there was a pause and everywhere you look to him a smile faded unless you have on me or my friends i think that the artificial intelligence engineers are the ones we're going to solve the mystery of consciousness we're gonna build the things that makes it possible to interest acts
we're going to build the mere we're going to make a minute one more thing this thought that this this the creation of both or fish want oceans has been mankind's purpose built into our brains from the very beginning according to the theory of missing you larry the technology is advancing at a exponential or at least plano me old case why in such a predictive graf why so predictable some believe the
technology is actually an extension of evolution that evolutionary advancements has been on this whole no no graf as well since the dawn of evolution on earth through biology has single cell organism become a mauled by cell organism weeks became real explosion and dinosaurs mammals monkeys humans and out of humans cons technology advance in advance and investment and out of technology calms the next species visible effect evolution and technology if on such ed
to her monastic unpredictable graff is necessary an unstoppable all we have stopped evolution through medical science now anybody can live there is no survival with its maybe you know evolution can't be stopped and the next logical step is necessarily synthesized life that this house to happen is a necessary extension of evolution and if you look at our technology through the ages we've had made of artificial intelligence in the columns on
jewish folklore to the fascination in the renaissance of ot hama in perpetual motion machines rene descartes and leonardo de vinci to the fiction of frankenstein and robots and of course violate to the obsession of artificial intelligence ever since the dawn of computing all the way back with alan turing an old mines since the nineteen fifties the creation ai seems to have been an obsession of humanity since the beginning it may be our destiny
and it may be inevitable were on the cost of something enormous my friends you cannot deny that what's about to happen maybe the biggest thing that has ever happened in human history consciousness okay that's the end of this episode i said people may be coming to this episode for its own right outside of the space of artificial intelligence a machine morning if you are interested in participating in the creation of consciousness in artificial intelligence is the right place to be yet no experience of our
the show and hold hands than my recommendation is to be involved in machine learning machine learning is the gateway drug so start at the beginning of this high caste series for the resources for this episode i'm going to leave you with one major resource i've recommended it to claim and time again it is a course by the great courses called the philosophy of mine brains consciousness of thinking machines it is it pays to see about everything up and talk about this episode and more there is great stuff out there by
aren't philosophers and cognitive sciences daniell dammit david chalmers et cetera but those are little bit more specialized one is star from the beginning degree courses series will guide you where to go from there some just believe you with that one resource and pro last episode but julia is going to tell you the game plan for the next few episodes whether estimates put this into two seasons stopping now i'm actually made you at least a few more episodes and they do some stuff on recurring allow works and calmly
shone on iwerks and then we'll reassess from there whether i'm going to stop and take a break but you've got at least a few more episodes out of me before my brain is run dry enough that nothing else to teach so let's make as much headway with my brain as possible and then i'll all and then we assess from their okay guys see you in the next episode

dub us environment in other words using eight of us as your local development environment now before we get started let's reflect back on acquire episode about doctor i didn't episode where i said you can a package up an environment and it's dependencies and their projects source code into a darker container and a ploy that doctor container to the cloud will we do is we're ready doctor file literally called doctor file with it
it'll be at the top of that doctor file you specify any operating system you can be using an end within the doctor file your gun as specified any number of operating system will packages you want one stall s. s. and k. gore are put up to tiananmen and you might install some pit packages you can either directly in line the doctor file suit against all tax wian c. or you can have the record as stock text file the kids copied into the doctor container in that thing gets kicked off with a pittance called the ripper
and stock tax and then we'll see in the doctor files is copy some host directory to the container directory or capitals see opie why copy space the location of the source code on your computer relative path so if you're working within your project route and at your project route there are a handful of miscellaneous files and then within the source to rectory that's actually the source code for your project lawyer python for
owls and then within the darker container it's expected to be running out of the forward slash actor director read one you'll see is caught the four slash source space for slash actor and what that will do is it will take your python files from the store structure in copy them into the act directory of the doctor container and then you'll typically have a darker composed r. y. m. l. file and that file will spin out a bunch of different doctor can
here's the wallet handle the orchestration of multiple doctor files the small scale few really wanna be deploying lots of doctor containers that scale and handled the networking above them all together you'll be using cooper nannies not darker compose doctor composes for very simplistic and barman slick on local host intruder in eddie's is for large scale deployment of doctor containers to cloud or not talking about cooper navy's your talk about that no layer episode it sort of me
mutually exclusive to the type of deadlocks that i'm talking about in this episode know last two episodes local los you have a darkened goes far to spend a good bunch of doctor containers and handles the networking of those containers to each other now has to developing on local host against you doctor containers what you'll see in those doctor compose files is volume mounts mounting it will take your local source directory and it will muir or it into the running die
her container so that copy command will actually copy of files into the doctor container one time snapshot fire and forget but the volume directive will mount your local directory into your doctor container at that destination in an hour way you can actually developed within your doctor container on local homes as your programming in tight charm on your local host your changes to your source files
give me your word to those source files location the darker container so makes editing your files on local host wall you're developing a breeze bought back hobby directive is the best thing that will actually be used when you actually build your doctor container your own doctor bills and then you put that up to the cloud that hobby directive is what takes a snapshot of your files mr structure to copy them over to that location in the dark continue
one time builds the doctor container and then pushes back to the cloud so the copy command is a one time deal the final is asian of coppinger files over into doctor container that the volume directive allows you to me are you did on a barman into doctor containers that you can and it's within your doctor or container on your local environment now this seems like alot of we're dark herself before getting into the tub us by you'll see why it is an analogy to the stalker and doctor compose staff when we're
talking about developing on a wor spin your local environment the other reason i'm dreaming of darker get in this episode is that doctors still can be used quite extensively in a job us and in this episode when i talk about using a u. s. as you all barman doctor is used very sensibly all over the cloud all over the internet all over a dub us even when you're using their manage services like a ws land aided us age maker east yes
for gave these are all things that you can use doctor within and is recommended that if you have that option did you do so for example in aid of us lambda which led to deploy its single python functions to the cloud as either rest and point or some python function that you'll be calling won office within your tax that well you can write your python function and provide along with it the requirements doc text file and a ploy that away and a function but if you how
whole lot of requirements being your requirements stock text file is preferred that instead you packages all ought as a doctor container and you deploy your lambda function as a doctor container and asked for various technical reasons one is that if you deploy u. lambda functions in the traditional way which is actually to build those pit requirements on local hostess it to them put them into the best reebok as is it filed and then
and you deploy your land of function from there which is pretty sloppy in my opinion and also there's a file size can't believe how lot of requirements jurgen exceed backpack very easily and oftentimes indeed the fall lambda environment safe for example the python three point eight landed in violet doesn't have the same sort of operating system set up that is needed for a lot of these picked installs an umpire being a huge one number doesn't work out of the box in the d. falwell
the environment sergei working edie fall and an arm is committed an act is that just doctor rice you're out then you'll use that doctor container has your lambda function because installing on pie with the doctor container was all done for you that's the magic of doctor containers the silent environments that the operating system while okay so bunch of doctor bill let's not talk about eight of us here is a pinpoint and i suffer from wow what to deploy a no fee to the cloud well i have a doctor compose all
i'll file on local post it has a post press darker container in fact the p. r. darker container a client doctor container in the server is able to communicate effectively with the database just fine because they're sharing the same network bridge it just access is the ports on local host five four three two in the choir they will access the server because again the containers the facts tape yeah i'd doctor container sets up all of the rock scene of network for quite
stan exposing the porch to local host on my behalf as of the clay hisses server the server is the database and then dates back to serve back to client fine and dandy on what the host though when it comes time to deploy this to the server that's not how they tell us operates in the u. s. is much more complex than that in orgy get my a server doctor container in the cloud i have to first push the doctor container to dc are the last
container registry on eight of us then i need to set up a u. s. four gates which is a sub service of peace yes elastic container services on eight of us for him at the c. s. is for doctor stuff is for deploy new doctor containers in any of us manage and byron i have to pull from dc are too far gate and then set up my whole for gay stuff okay so step one with the c. r. step to setting up for gate
step three is getting network requests to my forte container nakano why do that quantity of us you'll be using elastic low balance or a dolby or you'll be using the p. i. gave way and then bull slovo services need to be set up for handling network requests boxing each t. t. p. requests on down to your doctor container and those services have to be tied to a domain name that domain name
is gonna calm fromm began the u. s. roque fifty three and if you want access solved if you walk h. t. t. p. s. then you're also been a need to use the aid of us they see them service amazon certificates manager my database is gonna be deployed to party s. s. relational database service and exposing that database true mine doctor container on far gates is no small ordeal i have to set everything up with
nemec a dub us v. p. c. at the virtual private cloud i need a private sudden at the public's out neck with a year that gate way the server is to be placed within the private sat next an inward have outbound traffic it also need a gnat gave way the data bases to be within the private senate and also needs to have database submits associated with it all the parts within this stack need to have secured
groups set up so that they can communicate with each other and then at the part that is exposed to the internet user application load bouncer or to gag a way it is kennedy within the public seven that so that was a whirlwind did that confuse you good that's the point i'm trying to make is that everything you do on local host is almost entirely different wine wedge to how we're gonna be putting this into the cloud harding be putting us on a deed of us
and so what i offer to you to do instead is start developing on local hosea doctor compose file on prepared forty of us when that time coms and that time will come instead developed everything to wreck leave within it the dub us develop your entire environment from the get go in in a job us tech stack now how the heck would you do that
you have your local computer and then aliases the cloud business for hosting things in a cloud in the production or staging a fireman we mean developed in aid of us on developing on local host an ada bua says the u. n. at that doesn't make sense we'll try it doesn't make sense but there are ways to do this and that sort of be discussing here there are a number of ways to do this as on a tackle them bit by bit the first is the most obvious way to handle this and that is this
that your environment in the cloud yannick a dub us first we'll do is go go on a deal u. s. consul you printed count going to the console and the first step is to go into the dub us of the p. c. the v. p. c. or virtual private cloud is sort of the entry points to all your deal us stuff it's wedding caps awaits your services together into a single unit and allows them to communicate with each other through networking and keep some private from the internet can
safe and secure or an annual decide how you're gonna expose that the p. c. to the internet as the case may be so for example few walk the rest server or a web sockets server graf to wealth you'll set up your v. p. c. by way of securing groups and sob nests and entered a gay weighs in at aways molly sings such that one port is exposed to the internet and strung up to some servants bus service may be easy to work p. c. s were
forty eight or lambda seagoing for your v. p. c. you set your sadness and your security groups then you go on over to the i am console and you set up your users and you set your user and some permission stuff that you had on over to eight of us lambda and then from within lambda you can write your python code has worn off python functions at any time that up to the guy gave way and you expose it to
a gay way to the internet and was cool boulware that is that there's actually a coed environment on the lam that consul you can actually write your code for your lambda functions in the web browser using their python aidid or their jobs get aidid he saw this is option number one option what number one is not having the local garment whatsoever you write all your cody in the cloud in these lambda function handlers because there is an i. d. d. on lambda
the less you can get your coat your python code and deploy these land of functions test them the cetera is also an aide of us service called cloud nine is an entire aidid and server places adam on the local host or pie charm on local host not cloud nine does not wholly candle to supply charmed let's be clear cloud nine is meant for simplistic editing of coated in the cloud on eight of us but it is another wait
to handling this option one i'm discussing which is not having all the host whatsoever instead doing everything in the browser one year or the other u. s. consul so cloud nine you can get clone they get repository for get hot and you can get in your files on cloud nine and it keeps track of course of change files from get so then you can actually make those changes get commit push those changes and cloud nine is strong not to bother the of us sir
says like dc art am lambda so that it lets you run your services for testing your python functions so if you were serious about the your coat macleod you would not be using the lambda echoed editor as your bread and butter you'd be using cloud nine to endure python files and string nose up to lambda within cloud nines functionality for connecting your coach who lambda the lambda coordinator is
or for quick and it's to your land of conscience and of course perot last two episodes i discussed this sage maker studio has white python notebooks in the studio on fire and so you can and it's an orion and test and deploy aid your machine learning code in this age maker studio is using a different body didi vivendi cloud nine aidid is using high python used to burn no books so the amazon didn't lie
the jitters that is just was commonly used by data science and mushy learning engineers said they just set up an environment on stage maker said you can use the tools that are familiar with namely jupiter no books like python no books so few writing in testing and running in and deploying in your machine learning code you can do that ball in the cloud on stage maker studio tonight python old books as you doing the same for wed at four server
location code you can do that on cloud nine now that's a cool option developing everything a cloud has a handful benefits there one is that you not tied to your computer in our stock with a specific operating system supporting some functionally that you need more or less say you have a work computer at home computer anyone at the old pop back into your development environment well it's in the clouds so as can be propagated from your desktop that worked
we're just opera home 'cause just running in web browser or something i faced recently actually my computer doubted my mac guidance i had to transfer my environment over to my apc announced to cannibalize if i had set this all up in a cloud nine and sage baker studio i would have to deal with that the down side of the senate is that cloud nines and sage baker studio these are not enterprise gray yet by the g. e.'s these are not super powerful ids what times we really like our local host of armand we like
the tooling that we have on our computer by law of pie chart and i'll love gina grant degree it is for database management it said jack brains i a g e four day yet i can browse the tables and look at the table meditate itinerant sequel queries the consort and in wine center of an anti charm it is my preferred i t. e. for python development is is wonderfully powerful cloud nine sage makers doodle on a camel the pie
china comes to just law python editing capabilities so i'd still rather use these things and therefore i don't use option one but i just asked instead let's move on to option two options you is that you set everything in the cloud like i'd just mentioned you have your vp c. n. you're by am rolls nearby am user you have your party este de sewer lambda functions you have your v. c. r. doctor can to doctor repository eight yeah gay way wobble
blocked by when you want to get your coat on local hose and run some units casts against services in your tax back on a dub us you have to take one step and that is to connect to your local computer truly you ortega be west tech stacks of the pc by way of something called a client v. p. m. so you can set up something called
client vp an what that does is allows you to connect your local computer all right hon all and delegates from all truly your age of us is the p. c. and n. now when you want to connect to a database in york v. p. c. on any of us your part yes database you can do so because you're operating within the vp see you wouldn't otherwise be able to do that because your database was to be contained within a private v. p. c. does
wanna be exposed to the year that you only wonder database to be accessible to services running as servers whether as lambda functions or on far gate or peace yes or beseech you and those servers also want to be within the private side net of your v. p. c. and only accessible to the dinner next by way of your net gain weight on the public's avnet and that is hiding in to buy thirty p. id way or application labelle
sir so you don't have access to these resources the services on local host but you can get access to them if you can next to your v. p. c. by way of a client of the piano and so what would you do well you're right you're lambda functions as python functions you would attest to those functions now these functions may be making requests to a database on our t. x. or they may be grabbing secret accessed he's using
each of us secrets manager that's one way to store private dana like database user name and database password is not things you wanna stored in a can feed on jason file or as environment variable caesar's things you want to store in a secret manager which handles secret rotation encryption all these things automatically for you another thing that you don't really think up until you're starting a pusher stuff to be dubbed us sold your python function can access your party us today
it's in your secrets manager secrets and maybe ask us an sms and these other aid of us services and you can write your python function and you can run a unit tested against that python function and it will work because you're operating within the vp seed of the deplored the other us and by running a macleod and then when it comes time to actually deploy those functions then you do this set of packaging up those python functions in says it files or doctor containers and pushing them up to date of us lambda
and then finally the third option the last option is there is a service called a local stack local stack it is a open-source project it replicates the aid debbie west tech stack and it's all running on doctor containers on local host you have a doctor composed out why am i all file that spins out all whole bunch of local stack services and
the services are running on local host not on a wor s. on local host and they are fake the other u. s. services so you have a local staff s. affiliates service so you do is you don't you're doctor composed out why mel file you would enable the x. three service you'd say doctor compose out deep and local sacked will spin out by doctor container whose end points that you'll be accessing with your pry
jack to replicate everything and then to be debbie you wes is f. lee service offers same for dc s. and p. c. r. and co deploying code pipeline in r. d. s and every service and almost every service that they give us offers as actually quite an undertaking that's a really powerful service and i'm surprised that it works as well as it does that their accounting for all of these and pouring secure make
and coals to beat the job u. s. backed by way of rest calls or c. l. i. calls the aid of us see alive or bono three calls this local staff to project tries to replicate all of a dub us services and all calls they can be made it to those services and also replicate how were those services ron all on local host using dark
containers is pretty impressive and it's a daunting an overwhelming undertaking and there's gonna be som loose ends i imagine within the local stacked project i haven't used it extensively by the amount to which i have used it to his work surprisingly well sonnet keep using it for the time being but one thing to note is that it has a free tier emmett page here and a free tears all the typical sur le stuff
like lambda and past three and dynamo g. b. and the page here is all the rest of the stuff like r. d. s and v. c. yeah monroe fifty three in all these things as fifteen box 'em on sight if i recall correctly and so if you're gonna be using locals that extensively for setting up your deal us stacked bill bestselling what use their pro version and the benefit of using local sack over and actually deployed the debby west act is one cost savings
because if you're deploying and they tell us a stack and you're getting me into that stack from local host by way of a client the pc then running the server says macleod may cost you quite a lot for example party yes the database service it's kind of an expensive service where previously i was running my post crest database as a local doctor container now all i'm running it actually has a hosted a part
he asked database on a date of the west the main reason being that i want to develop against well actually be here facing way if in the real world when i'm developing against the local doctor container hosting post grass well that's really easy to work with it bypasses all the stuff that i would need to set up macleod so instead i deploy in a party yes instance to ada bua spite played the piano into that
the p. c. and i had actually have to make sure that might i am policies and my son that's in my secured eager for all set up correctly so that i can connect to the database so it's making sure i do things right the first time measure twice cut once and running that party este based is a little bit expensive is not terrible with little bit expensive but since then i ran all that on local host using local stack which is using doctor containers but the entire is set up such that it
acts the way board yes would act in the clouds are still do need to set up those v. p. c.'s inside nasa security groups nor to connect to my local party yes database then i'm saving the cost of running that database macleod on paying fifteen bucks a month for the program but that still cheaper than what i'd be paying for spinning up an art yes instance multiple times throb week in a cloud hands in or once a lot faster because it's running on local host there's low latency in making
he's now work requests to local close as opposed to the clout connecting at any dinner facing with these services will be olaf astro mobile homes as opposed to climb vp entering into a v. p. c. and if i make changes to my eight eight of us back by way of terror for for example which are to be talking about midday here then that deploying those changes lot faster on local host using local sacked venues on the job us when you act
the kickoff infrastructure changes aunt ada pos is actually lake bringing on wine hardware and moving things around from one physical location to another physical location so that your architecture changes get reflected in the cloud before it's available to you to now with the p. and back into two tester changes doing that all all go host through local stack it just brings all the darker containers down and brings them back up the way needs soon it's really fast it's really easy
to deploy your infrastructure changes using tear form on local host of local stack now i brought up before the idea of mounting your source directory into your darker can cheered as opposed to copying the source into the dark container for a build there is essentially an equivalent of that for local stack there's no way local stock for mounting you'll pull hosts source files to your lambda functions are being deployed as law
i'm the rest and points in your local stack infrastructure and that really is due to see here to treating the job us as a local development environment because otherwise without being able to mount york hold true lambda functions that are as quote unquote employed you're gonna have to basically rice and cohen and a ploy to landed in the work no okay tweaked echoed deployed for an end to the work man that can be really painful process so
another huge benefit all local step is it allows you to mount your local python functions to your quote unquote deployed lambda functions and that way you can continue to be in line it it to your land of functions in pi charm waldo vaulting running and testing your code so those years three options we have developed everything in the cloud you don't even use and i eat eat eat you use cloud nine and sage maker studio best option one option shoe
what is spin everything up in a cloud by developed on local host black why old developing on local host you're still connecting the services macleod not connecting to running a darker instances on local host know your connecting to running a day of us services or doctor containers running on a of us services and you were connecting to those by way of applied the p. n. n. in the third option is that you're running everything on local host in local sack
which replicates the p. l. u. s. text act and now you can access it all mobile homes and eventually connects to a presumably with a client bbc is well so if you wanted to set up your client the p. c. on local host to local stacked so that you cannot do that again in your cloud and barman when it comes time you wanted just do a few quick test against you or are deployed environment before picking everything off one other major benefit of developing against each of us
first is that you become acquainted with the offerings of the dub us and start to realize that they're all lot more offerings on a fabulous they can replace things that you would otherwise using your project as it packages for example and that will actually get the job done better more securely and hosted in that if you had developed everything on local postman doctor can tear you might not have known about you might have foregone and then when it comes time to deploy duke
out you wish to use that dwi service instead so for example in the sage maker episodes are talked about using data wrangler to transform your features and impute missing day yet in all these things well if i had known about the wrangler were i was writing one of my machine learning code in the past i would not have donned that costume by hand in hand as if his dear wranglers handling of it is gonna be more robot
stick simpler to set up an upscale all importantly with data coming in from some stream of the deal wait a minute be using eventually deploying no feed i need that to pipeline to scale and the waves with now is not steel ball so i will be transferring might cost i'm a feature transformation coded today that pipe one so they can scale so that there's various points in the pipeline and to tap into some for example getting the
normal and getting us at different entry points of my machine learning architecture i wish i'd known about that first 'cause i wouldn't have written it the way i did i assumed that this needed to be done in python another component being sage maker experiments their hyper planner optimization capabilities would rather had i known and heavy use experiments so they can distribute and scale running my hibor planner optimization jobs rather than though
way i handle them all on one computer at present in my jeep you based doctor container will doesn't stop the sage maker there's a whole bunch of services on eight of us they can replace components of what would be for example york python server sold another doctor container in no fee is the entire web server the whole thing is running on fast eighty i've been fasting yeah i hamilton whole lot of things for you and your third party plug ins for fasting
god for handling other things one examples the proxy never requests well the gag a way war application low bouncer old to that automatically for you you don't need to deal where all like engine attacks and how are moving day she p. requests from the internet's to your container one other thing is actually a load balancing or for example let's say you want some rest and points of your server to be throttled so that anyone user on the internet
he had hit that endpoint a million times a minute well the key i'd gave way has a built-in you can just click it check box and say throttle this route we only want one user to be a bullet hit this and point x. amount of times per second where previously i was using a fast the p. i've plenty n. for throttling specific rest routes that one is called slow eap aren't given fassett the isle of slow them down welcome a guy that an any use a gag aways built-in
handling all of fraud owing and finally another example is the storing up of the user accounts this was really important for early i'm using a fast the gagged one and that handles storing user counts to the data base their user name enhanced password an e-mail invalidating them as necessary sending the forgot passwords if necessary sending it a activation code and i have to string all add up myself i have to spa
safire those often routes as throttles be using slow eight yard and i have to send out the jade of the u. t. jocks we call it which is sort of that authentication tokens this commonly used in the web development space when you log in to use your count on the server big shot gets sent down to the client beckett stored somewhere like a beast teach people only cokie on the web browser and then you send out that jocks flu
mercer virtuosity to rest requests for that user and you also have to handle invalidating that jocks if the user changed their password you have to handle expiring that jocks every five minutes or so and then requesting your refreshed token all this stuff all that stuff around authentication took me weeks even with the plug ins and tooling available to me from the fasting p. i'd ecosystem
i'm just not comparable handling authentication on my own even wasted being managed as open-source projects i would rather there be a service dedicated to user can storage authentication and all of the security and e-mails of new account forgot password and activation and in validation appointing someone serves it does is automatically for me and blow on the hold it of us has a service called courtney yell i did not know that
no it into asserted put no water my stuff on any of us if i had known that in advance i would have developed the usury count system in the court need elk now i am migrating the user can system of fromm fast tape yeah i to cardio and so one benefit had identical being against each of us first instead of a darker based global environment is i'd probably would have discovered this service early on in the phase
and i and then i would measure twice and caught wants in fact as i'm going through my server module by module and point by ten point one finding myself doing is getting the entire server stack the entire server stack and instead moving and briefing into single a dub us lambda functions so previously i had won the old doctor container was a bit jail
in python functions all as fast a p. i rest and point's well now all with all of the cooling available to me by way of the gag a way a gag aways web sockets supports their authentication and authorization handling it by way of carbon yo and the authorization hair hitting eap egg aways jock to validate or i can just write these functions as single python functions without
any tooling you know like database connection cool management stuff like this is steady leave it to be a u. s. to handle all the men at cooling that i would otherwise be handling myself by deploying each function as single lambda rest and points you know way all of eight of us is offerings sort of replace you're not only your infrastructure sack which is obvious because that's what they give us is is clough
i'm hosting thereby infrastructure but also replacing one of your modules and plug ins and framework say you'd be using at the server are hosting lovell now setting up your environment the trish always to go on to the key of u. s. consul in the web browser and then you click around you set the vp c. n. i am user in r. d. s database some way and a function string everything together put all the hunted yeah gay way clicking around into
being in things this way is not manageable very on manageable and becomes more and more on manageable overtime and you want to be old track these change sets these changes you make to you are stacked in some way that you can replicate see in the future so for example if you were spinning not a text back in the infrastructure we call it on a dub us for setting up a database in a gag a way inland
functions and you're doing this to get away from your local doc curtain closed out why the alfaro and you previously had your doctor composer ueno filed in gates one get hot well then future users and future you will miss the tracking of infrastructure changes in gates and you would have to sort of describe two at a future use your heart set up you text back with clicks keeping track of all of that and managing your infrastructure in the web consul isn't
non starter it is not the way to handle meiji era for structure on a ws instead what we use is a concept called infrastructure as code word infrastructure in code and there are number of projects out there for this chef and ann sobel been very popular one is called care reform cheat or rpf or can care reform as to why use and tara form lets you write code
that sets up your tax that quantity of us its infrastructure as code and our way you can put your chair form files in to get into your kitzhaber posit tori and so that when you move from one computer to next computer or another user calms on board and they wanna set up the same infrastructure for testing the code and running that project they just ranchera formed in it's an inter form applied annual take those terror forms
owls and it will set up the infrastructure on a job us so what you do with terror form is that you the first step is to make sure you have your ada be asked by eight am credentials set up on local host and we use those i'm credentials to make sure it can spin up services in the cloudy has the right permissions to create services managed services on your behalf on a dub us the money raised her form files
one might be for setting up your priam rolls on other one might be for setting up your land of functions another one for your party yes database another one for your v. p. c. for securing groups your side that's your client vp and for setting up your client began and to your certificates on a c. m. for s. s. l. h. d. b. s. and your route fifty three domain amen always thinks you use some off the shelf sample terror form files you modify them to your liking
and then you run for four minutes and her form applied and it will set up your entire infrastructure or your entire text act on a daily us in the cloud in the new king king next to that text back with your client c. p. n. and then at the end of the day when you're done with you or developments when you're done coating against this stack you can run a turf war and destroy it and it will bring all of that infrastructure off line so if it weren't for terror form war
c. t. k. horror server less framework for one of these other things all be discussing a bit these infrastructure as cold projects into war for these projects i would not be doing this episode because it would not be worth managing the setting up of your infrastructure all through the web you why because if that's what you had to do anyway if you were stocked with stringing together your entire infrastructure on any of us with clicks and typing in webs
earns them in the pain point then mentioned at the beginning this episode of your local of armand being different than your cotton foreign well that would be a moot point you have to set up your cloud and farm about her weight anyway why because we have this infrastructure is code projects liked her form we can orchestrate the development of our cloud environment in code and then we can put ourselves into that environments and that way we let us say we measure twice cut
but once we set up burn barman the way it it's intended that we can develop against we do the hard work first and then we can replicate that environment to a staging environment to pay development are meant to re testing in vermin and finally to production and terror form is not the only option other players said ann sobel and pop it in chef these are all popular framework says well on their framework so little bit more popular and modern but i see in me
use today there's amazon c. t. k. that is the amazon cloud of development kicked it's essentially liked her form is a infrastructure as code framework written by any of us for a job us for deploying your services to the clout and then taking them off wife union the future now why the hell why not use c. k. and championing everything a debbie us in this in the last two episodes this
ek is what might be in the u. s. forty debbie west where the heck where i'm not be using c. b. k. and said i'm using tear form well this a couple of reasons and their love it more personal for mining project one is that at present currently see the case alluded knew or didn't care for one or the limitations i find lucy became visited does not support no on manage services like cloud needed services for example so one stinking coy
i got hung up on what i was working on a project that's so one point i got stuck on one hours working on a project at dat was that i wanted to deploy as chat walked in i did this by way of the dub us lacked speedily as lex busy chat box serbs elect's you set up a box with a handful of conversation flows and any number of responses to give in utterances and then the slots
he named entities that we're gonna be pulling out of the users' response is so few had a customer service bonnet said hi how can i help you to name the person said credit card help it would pull out record as a slot well setting all the spot this is not a service did you manage like beseech you work for gate in the traditional sense on eight of us is a cloud need of offering cloud native means these rest calls rudy's got a three calls that you make any don't have to manage the
running in hosting of u. or servers c. k. does not support currently november twenty twenty one does not support setting up alexa box that there's a bunch of stuff you need to do is set out black spots sure it's not i can manage to service by there is still stuff he needed to set up the data set up these example conversations and the types of slots we walk alone staff as a terror form supports that bessie case does not terror form supports all lots of
nurses lot more services and most of the other infrastructure is code projects out there that i've found including and most of the cloud native and server less capabilities on eight of us in azure n. g. c. p. so that's the main reason why it shows terror form over c. t. k. another reason lots of people choose terror former over c. k. is it your form is universal it works on g. c. p. and the microsoft
azure and other clouds services and other cloud of supervisors were c. k. is just for a ws the benefit of c. t. k. is it easier to use and it's amazon first so first class citizen so c. t. k. will continue to improve and rapid clip supporting more and more debut as services and tying into them very effectively maybe in a way it's such that where terror form because it covers
such a whiny the territory would give anyone a job you esther russell little bit of second class support just by the nature of being such a big project in a big undertaking c. k. would be loaded more fine tuned and dialed in first class support for the sake of us services i don't know that that really is something you worry bout i have not had any shortcomings on a hill us with terror form at present it supports everything i've
ever needed to support in a very efficient and bob fried capacity but the biggest thing i see the biggest difference i see is a tear for ms very evil blokes in this complex is a huge learning curve worse c. k. is really dial in and sleet and very efficient and stream winds it's less code c. k. is less code then terror for the terror for covers more services take your pick us up to you on aka champion one over the other bride personally
stir form and then there's this thing called the server was framework which is really popular infrastructure is codes framework but it really you mostly supports her was technologies is really dial in for dwi slam dunk and dynamo deep eap aidid wake them less so for party yes for example or g. s. is not the server less service is a managed hosted the basement clark and so the server less framework is less like
lead to be compatible with these non server lists services and more compatible with the server lust services like it at this lambda and dynamo t. b. so that's another reason i choose terror form or server list now finally we talked about local stack hosting your entire or the dub us tax act on local host care reform and c. t. k. are compatible with local stacked so you write code be a new war terror form
files that tells her former we're actually pointing to a local host knocked to the cloud you set up a whole bunch of it and points the inside your turf on file b. c. 's for us to local roads dynamo dubious local host a gag a rigorous local host and then the next time you enter form applied actually runs it against your local stock environment and it works it actually spins out all those them barman using tear for infrastructures quote the way we do
against the actual he got us cloud and then again huge benefits of terror form of infrastructure is code generally is that if you wanna make a modification to your tax back you ron terror form applied and then it applies at just that and it just apply some modification annabelle propagate modifications through your tax act as the case may be which is super powerful so for example if you make him
modification to your v. p. c. or to assad met with in the vp see your security group within some sob ned well if you were to do that in the browser you have to then go to all your services every single service that needs to be made all we're all that modification and you would have to then click into that service and then i just for that modification as needed and some things are in a slip through that
racks you're not forget about some services that need to be made aware of those modifications terror form will not if you make a modification to som deployed service in york infrastructure and terror for mizell way or the dad is a dependency and all other services in your infrastructure they will first make the modification to that service let's say v. p. c. and then it will propagate the necessary modifications through your entire infrastructure
to those other services it knows how to make only the modifications necessary without doing anything to destructive and another example of non destructive modifications a tear for ms cole act is if you write multiple lambda functions on local host and let's just talk about landed here this is really powerful bissell showcase how efficient her form as let's say you have five when the functions top five python functions on local host maybe a handful of that
our web server functions handful are worn off functions and that you want to call from within some other area of your stack let's say one function is actually a prawn job so you can connect your leno whole host to reorient us the pc using klein vp and so that you can run these python functions better eventually to be calm lambda functions you can run them on local
host maybe you're running these functions in a high test sweet the unit tests suite is to call for these various functions and then it is able to you on within your v. p. c. so you have access to the services that you need within york eight of us infrastructure and then after you run your tests against your functions you're content with these functions and i you are deployed east the lambda and tara form well how these lambda of module chunks
with your turf firm file where you point that block true that file and they will handle automatically when you enter from applying it will handle packaging them out as is a thought putting in august three if asked you deploying the lambda function and then if you have specified to find that out to the p. id way and setting up the necessary permissions so that's cool you're a bypass a whole lot of the steps that you've had to take wake packaging that is it
file perignon s. three and then deploying to lana for mass three s. three step process that you're able us get just by using tear for them the next step is let's say that you modify one of those functions only hands you leave the rest alone us a new test school we're back in business and terror formed attacks that told you that file has been changed based on zombie hashing our rhythm above like the modification date of that file one desk
this sort it all it hoist unnecessary changes to a single and a function not to the other land of functions and if necessary it may propagate some additional changes let's say two deep yeah gave way where it's tides to that specific land a function so everything i'm saying about developing against a dub us on local host as opposed to a darker got wine all file is only really feasible if you're using infrastructure is cold
liked her form is made especially feasible at least a lot quicker and save some money if you're using buhl local stack framework but i'd have antacid local sacked super for ollie so as far as the amount of coverage of capabilities of aid of us that they handled your mileage may vary but is four feet trying out first and of course we're in the machine running up white hot gas so within you were the pc connected
through the coin the piano's you are you have access to sage maker you can kick off stage maker training jobs so free this episode which are praising sage maker's studios like python no books to write your machine learning code so that you can kick off machine learning jobs within the sage maker environment well you can opt to create a sage maker studio project you can set them all up either in the web browser in aid of us is console using sage major studio
or are you can orchestrate the infrastructure set up all of sage maker through terror for months that and then it buchanan came next to your sage maker environment within your client vp and so that you can kick off training jobs and all that stuff on local hosts rather than being on stage maker studio now why would you wanna do that wall let's say you're doing the rest of your web to thalmann servers development for the way
i've described in this episode or maybe you don't wanna mix it up too much so we wanna keep our machine learning developments on the same time in byron clyde beatty and connected for the p. c. so that we keep kids off stage maker jobs but to move so they could use by charm on all white guy python notebooks personally i don't like you burned nearly as much as i like jet brains pie charms such a powerful id the so violence is continued he use my id eat for developing my machine learning code on local host but then i'm able to come
next to the stage megan firemen second still lion sage maker or training jobs and inference job zen experience of hyper prayer optimization all less stuff on local close enough so when when and of course you still get all the bells and whistles of sage bakery can still then hallway into sage major studio on the web and ruled that the future porn says that's just it out from shack in autopilot cornered spearman for new training job the model monitored clarify
all these things is still be all the output based on the features that are provided by sage maker but you can simply do your development on local host so that's how you can develop against a bill us on local most measure twice cut once start building your project on a dub us as if you're running these ads like test data bases or test servers connect to it with the clyde beatty and so they you're within the environment to run your test co
and now way when it comes time for deploying your stacked in our canadian side swiped by all that set up you'd normally have to do this on terror for infrastructures coat or siddiqi a horse arose from work because managing your infrastructure in the wet interface all the aid of us or azure orgy c. p. as in not gonna happen simply not happen for complex infrastructures and give local second try soon you might beals do all the stuff on local host now oh
like i said this is all a bit mutually exclusive to an alternative to height of infrastructure orchestration systems one of which is true in any case i'm actually in be talking to somebody adapt here soon to give me a rundown on how krueger nannies and crew buffalo especially for example for machine morning pipeline orchestration compares to cloud hosted it managed services the way i'm describing in
zepa sewed they're entirely different ways of handling infrastructure krueger nannies what true burnett he says is you give it a bunch of doctor files so all of your services for whitney has darker files okay rather than using more real wine on the manage services that are offered up on a dub us or azure orgy c. p. you're relying instead on open-source projects contained in doctor containers
so for example in a yummy us if you want a message to use ask us well the open-source equivalent west us there's something called zero m que anders rabbit and you so you can use rabbit times you doctor container and then for the server you do you see dirty job us lambda or forget the hostess or that i might use the ws lambda for running a server on any of us well you would actually hoster server maybe as a doctor eyes fasted he eyed container two
bring many states all these containers strings them altogether handle an hour came between them put them all into its own version of the p. c. and then deploys all of these services to the sea two instances if your ear be running this on eight of us or the equivalent of instances non je c. p. or microsoft azure so krueger nannies is intended for re legal relying on doctor and open source projects
ooh slurring all of your services together you're not gonna be using a dub us as your backbone really ought to be tapping into the various services are made of us you are to be hosting it on eight of us with cupboard eddie's would you see pure azure wherever you are a host it but the services themselves and the way they communicate with each other and away the scale pop and down that's all managed by trooper nannies not by each of us it's all open-source stuff that handles itself and
and you deployed the trooper nettie staff to be of us into run eddie's has what's called this master server on the control plane that does all the orchestration of your services with respect to each other and i will do us smartly and as cheap as it can so for example to have multiple services and they all expect some number of ram and c. p. u. n. three of them are running on one easy to container that actually has extra program
and c. p. you available then it will spin up but doctor container on that dc to be instance rather than spinning at a new dc to instance so anyway all essay that cover nannies is entirely different mutually exclusive fashion of deploying your architecture to cloud one which relies heavily on doctor files and open-source projects and what it does is it has this mask
sir and it keeps dibs on who's who within this back in order to decide whether we're going to steal upper scaled down certain containers with him this back as opposed to care reform or c. d. k. or service framework which is infrastructures coded is actually managing services that are offered by a dwi asked these are not necessarily open-source offerings they're not necessarily darker containers though they k.
and the terror for manages your stacked on a day of the u. s.'s cloud offerings by a dub us other mutilate squeezes the internet is actually consulate cos there's a feed the crewman eddie's feed to run your control plane in the clouds as one downside of kern eddie's went outside is that is sort of busy universal solution so you can move you work for many sack off avail us and on to g. c. p. and aid of u. s. c. c. p.
and azure they all support to burn eddie's they all have a service that supports to one eddie's this is not just as support out of the box each of us is services supports to burn eddie's is called the tape s. and by running your true bernice clustered in ek s. service that's it is iniki guess that you actually encourage that feet to run your clusters control plane and the reason i'm bringing up to one eddie's here is that it is another alternative to infrastructure esque
oh terror form it is a project for infrastructure is coat and so was cooper nannies but that they handle deploying your stacked the cloudy been totally different ways another reason i'm bringing up is because as i mentioned i'm going to be interviewing somebody from debt on how they used to burn eddie's to deploy machine learning pipeline to the cloud by way of cuba flow and so rather than using sage maker this person and that is actually using cooper nannies
to orchestrate the entirety of staff everything i discussed in the last two episodes of ingesting your day death and transforming the day impugning knowles feature store everything it's scales my cursory says dana pipelines training monitoring debugging him and deploying this person rather than using sage makers hosted offerings on any of us is using cube flows open-source containerized offerings in or
to string together the entire and and dana pipeline in a universally deployable and open-source fashion which has it's perks no doubt as so i will be reporting back here soon on how things like tube flown to burn eddie's compared to manage services like sage maker and they give us all orchestrated through terror form so hope to get you that at this
but in the near future at all see you then


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash and algae it time also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called black mayors like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode eighteen natural language processing part one in this episode i'm going to
ark about the sub field of machine learning called natural language processing and l. p. and l. p. is a sub field of machine learning and is quite the radical i'm going to take you on an adventure away from machine learning proper us specialization we've been machine running this is going to be a three part series this first episode i'm going to be describing the general topics in an l. p. in the next episode will talk about the shallow learning in traditional approaches to anna
he and in the third episode all talk about work for me own networks and more to that that is the deep learning approach state of the art in an l. p. l. p. is a microcosm of machine learning proper it's his own world of machine learning our rhythms and l. p. uses maybe half traditional machine learning algorithms and a half of its own algorithms dedicated to its own fields semester i mean i'm going to be taking your rabbit hole excursion away from machinery
hopper by now as the time is any to start thinking about specializing in machine learning you get to a point in your machine running career or you know the fundamentals of an owl algorithms the math the general approaches but nora big anywhere new career you need to get really good at something specific in machine learning there's that image guy is the reinforcement learning guys endgame ai and self driving cars it's hind forecasting keep
all who do stock markets are weather forecasting etc and there is the language people battling with processing is everything related to language in the domain of the knin machine learning spoken word written tax machine translation if words are involved in any capacity natural language crossing is what we're dealing with micah said at some point you choose to specialize i can think of it like in our keiji we reached level ten you have to choose area b. m.
age you're warrior or robe well a level ten machine learning once you got your basics down even have to choose which specialty wanna go to an issue and so i personally actually it's hatch r. p. g. classes to these various specialties i think of the time series people who work with time series forecasting especially in the stock market is the rogues right because it deals of money i think of the reinforcement learning people who were dealing with action sequences like in the game ai insult driving cars and think of them as warriors because ago
well with my warrior defeating the dark lord analogy from a prior episode i don't really have a big class for that image people maybe honduras because they have to have good eyesight omelet support our g. but there's the image recognition camp people are doing is classification and tagging light are processing for some driving cars and damage related machine learning is especially popular today with the rise of virtual reality and augmented reality be able to handle motion detection in room skill sets as well as on 'em
it seemed imagery onto real life objects etc and then naturally with crossing i think of them is the mages wizards because they just have to cast spells with language right with incantation say cast spells the real lot of books so i think of the mages is the language people naturally which costs and incidentally it is an l. p. that i've personally chosen for my own career i do want to promote an elk he has a very viable career choice specialization in machine learning it just so happens that
every machine learning to interview i've had thus far has been an l. p. related i don't know why they're not targeting me because of an l. p. in my resume and i'm not targeting them because of an elk he'd done the job descriptions i think it is so happens that an old he is a very rich and promising ecosystem in machine learning in the job market today if you think about it makes sense is so much value they can be hat through natural language crossing think about the various
cesspool companies in machine running out there and what they're working on sunday siri and google assistant though the matalin was causing you talk to it whether speech for taxed and a response to you after performing some action advertisements are still want most profitable industries around facebook while let company is particularly good at image related tasks such as facial recognition in the image of loads stiller bread and butter is advertisements and how did it
i mean what advertisements to show your users by natural language processing on the things they write the things people write to them et cetera and of course the granddaddy company of all natural language processing ever is google everything gould as is an l. p. when you perform at a google search you cast in a query you'll find all related pages on the internet raids by relevance your query if you're query was constructed in question formats the whirlpool
you're really answer your question at a relatively new feature this card at the top of the search results will literally answer your question if you go balsam and c. n. organization or a person will show you a bunch of information about that and be on the right side bar few duel with it he it'll show you a picture of their lobo when there were founded where they're located who their founders were etc an image or your revenue made at two boys by ads advertisements relevance to query you searched on
customized to your typical query history everything is language everything is an l. p. so there's money there's potential and there's jobs so i highly recommend considering an elk he has your particular specialization within machine running okay so let's talk about an elk he has is a microcosm of machine learning is an elk he is little bubble machine learning that looks in general what machine learning where previously in the world of can
shooting we programs discreetly specific tasks one thing started yielded too complex for that we had set enabled the machine tool earn a generalized to perform particular tasks whether it's productions were making actions that's the same in the world of an elk he and all peace started with linguistics linguistics simply the study of language with grammatical structure with what parts of speech words represents how semantics or hold
the sentence structure how certain things means certain things linguistics study of language it's been around forever on natural language processing is computational linguistics the another word for natural light was crossing is computational linguistics so one point in time the field an elk he was specifically dedicated to encoding in the machine all rolls of linguistics that we have enumerated heart coded and l. p. version one was hard coding grammatical struck
your sentiments oriented words parts of speech rolls into a database or spreadsheet work sri some sort of hard code system that will enable our algorithms to parse tax as a result of that being hard coded l. p. in its infancy was not considered a branch of machine learning it was considered a branch of ai machine running as a branch of ai an adult he was a branch of ai so machine learning and an l. p. were siblings then
a machine learning started to untangle and help you with its whoops sorry to contribute significantly to the performance and flexibility of the algorithms in the space of a penalty so much so that one might be forgiven to say that an elk he mostly consists of machine learning our rhythms there are of course construct some data structures and tasks which are trying to perform with the n. l. p. which give it specificity and autonomy uniqueness of its own words
still it's own fields people and steady linguistics people could set a penalty with that anybody who's anybody in the world and l. p. today is applying mushy learning algorithms to penelope another comparison i'm going to make to the microcosm of which she learned is that like machine learning with world is now moving towards deep warning models deep learning models acting as one models rule them all they can do sort of spring cleaning on all these dedicated task machine learning models improving
complexity inaccuracy in certain circumstances and oh he is doing the same the current state of the n. l. p. is a myriad of shallow learning she learning models and cutting edge of an elk he is steep learning specifically algorithm recover in the third part of this series called rip current neural network augmented by way of something called word to that deep learning and deep learning what those models us is one more complex and flexible systems for
taxed parson but to one model they can handle so many tasks that previously required dedicated models with in the world of natural language processing soul talk about the learning in the third at some burnout way you can see penalty is all three branches machine running in it's own way autonomously has it's own agent it has gone through sort of the same growing pains of experiences the machinery proper has gone through in a way it's also a microcosm of machine
and so like i said in this episode i'm just going to talk about the general goals and tasks and parts of an l. p. i'm not going to be talking about algorithms toby for the next episode but i wanted to see two space and motivate the different types of things you can be applying an old piece you know like i said simplistic we can just think of an elk he has anything related to language taxed spoken word anything if it had seduced language it's an l. p. now what makes penalty special compared
other fields and she learning is that we are dealing with tax machine learning wants to work on math on numbers text is not numbers and so i know he has construct for converting tax the numbers were handling tax and some bag of words model et cetera that some ac unit compared to other machine and system's another thing that makes an l. p. you need is it is sequence based sentences are we're we're we're we're we're we're words can modify h. other than
grammatical structure influences the meaning of the overall sense so the model that will be using an old he or sequins based models or kind series based models if you recall for prior episode what's a good algorithm for time series the stock market's chains will get to that in the next episode with the market models now even though i'm not going to be discussing our rhythms in this episode of his name dropped out rhythms as i go through some of these parts i find that helpful kind of like reading chapter hundreds of a tax bill
knowing what you're getting yourself into so that help he i like to break it down into three three layers three tiers that this is not something that exists in and out yet never seen it presented this way this is a tyler thing at the top level we have goals like large tasks that we're trying to perform very high level very lofty big things that we're trying to do like machine translation or be answering questions the big step below that are sort of medium level two
asks so i call it tasks that are essential in order to achieve our goals things like teasing apart the sentence structure of the tax cuts call parsing syntax tree parsing or figuring out what role at each word play is in a sense that call part of speech tightening or figuring out which components of this seconds more important for particular task pulling out names of people were dates were things
it's called names and city recognition so these medium level tasks are essential to accomplish our lofty goals to have goals we have tasks underneath that and we have parts and i just consider these the sort of text pre processing the little bit spots in and to just have to do and get over with things like cocaine is asian were you have a document was the word to me at the top but it's all works to turn it into a list of words warlord k.
seen all of those words if you do go wolfert queried well you probably don't want the capitalization that the user put into the queried to matter for the capitalization as it exists in wet pages to matter though probably lower case there fiske word lower case the documents seeking to ease your matching another thing will talk about it called limits his nation and standing where you turn something what we're hunting hunted hunt her etc into the just the word hunt so that if the document has all worth it is important you but not in the morph
logical contract that is presented it's still counts so these parts this lowest level tier of an elk he is this just basically this text pre processing so i'm going to talk about these three tiers and individually before we get into that i wanna talk about a very important distinction between two words what is syntax together semantics syntax and semantics it's important distinction to have your minds matter what walk of life doesn't have to be en el pizza maybe is that
initial hope you outside of this pod cast syntax is sentence structure said was at syntax is the structure of the language as it is presented its it'd be like parts of speech so what role each word play is whether it's a noun verb adverb is cetera parts of speech syntax tree parsing so part of speech constituents so what amount freeze or more full logical presentation work so does the worse for without proper case or leonard is asian and stemming in all
things so it's basically just the structure of tax syntax semantics is the meaning of taxed the meaning of the fundamental take away after you read a sentence so semantics is important especially for our high level goals i love machine translation for example machine translation can't just work on syntax as you'll see we talk about machine translation have to be able to encode
it's being said in some fundamental way in on the computer so they can be de coded into the intent in the other language or we get to the n. l. p. deep learning episode this thing called work to back is basically building a dictionary of words as they relate to each other can text sully is really like building up the meaning of words in the dictionary not just the list of words a bag of words a cog not just the list of words with nothing attack
so then billy conn with some sort of meaning attached them in a fundamental way so syntax is grammatical structure send structure phrase structure even worse structure and semantics is niemi important fundamental to take away from all we're worth sends word documents syntax versus semantics and you'll see those serbs sort of categories of different types of tests that will be performing okay parts of the low-level stuff
like text pre processing tasks like that middle level of stuff which is basically you sing tactic parsing of words and senses and goals for the high level big things we're trying to achieve what machine translation our search engines etc so let's start with parks we're now beginning our lesson on an l. p. a. documents is just all blob of taxed whether it's a sentence or a paragraph or a chapter or a book however you want
the fina documents that a lot of tax a court this is the list of documents so when we're working with natural language processing they're very popular core cora which is the plural of corporates are very popular core pour out there what is called the pen tree bank basically anything with panda work hand in it p. d. n. a. and stands for pennsylvania is in the university of pennsylvania you pen is significant
traitor to whirl of an l. p. and they've built all lot of court for a list of documents out there for use in training our models in and out the sole one court this might be a list of news articles in the view that for detecting something about news another court this might be a list of documents which is really useful for learning how to parse sin tax structure from sentences for one reason or another maybe there are examples of very
easy part trees mixed with examples of very complex partially cetera that one in particular is the pantry day so we corpus the list of documents which may be useful for some learning process in our cannot he endeavors okay we have a court vessel was the documents we are the document any tax blobby won whether it sends a paragraph chapter books etc and in every document is composed of words we call every word of the token token i
token is low but more complex than just the word token can include smiley faces or punctuation or anything like that it's on the individual component of your document is important and can play as a contributor to parsing of tax then we will use it as a token so simplistic we can think of tokens just words more complex an addict natalie being a number of things like punctuation smiling faces another bits so corp hora house documents documents have tokens
then we will operate on these tokens in any number of ways for example in pre processing our documents for use in our machine learning models we may want to remove shock garbage we call these stop words words like called handed ah vaught these awards dinner so frequent that kind of grammatical fillers they play an important role in grammar if your doing very complex machine learning tasks we
indeed depend on grammatical structure than you do what we saw around busy doing very simple task which simply depends on the words in the dark medulla say you're doing a search query any disqualifying documents that have a high school or heart height weight as it pertains to the words in your query that you don't care about these stop words so one tree processing step might be to throw way stop words major machine learning over the morale of the faster because yet once they get the war
on another thing you can do with tokens is to reduce them not more full logically produce more full logical variation so morph biology is the structure of work whether it has the upper case in the fight or what affix says it has whether it's by angie work edu past present future tents stuff like this so the structure word is this more fallen c. n. you can reduce its morph
what he by removing some stuff let's say you one removal ion g. o. p. d. or any of those things to reduce all words that have past present future tense whenever it's just it's one day's work it's stam it's called us so this process is called stemming so what is it previously if i'm doing this google search crews and i'm looking for cutting equipment or what is hunting season or something like that will do will probably wants to reduce any variation
oh hi it's whether it's past present future tense vintages the base for hot sold chop off the ends of both the words and documents that it is green against and my query i don't think it actually does that is is an example so that's the stand this damn it is the core of the word by removing the thing that can make it very from tends to tense or whenever a very similar concepts to stems and stemming oral lemons and let his asian
oh p. m. and a llama now for the purposes of this pot cast episode you can think of them as identical stan is the same thing as alana stemming is the same thing as one of his nation their differences on standing as as far as i understand it as little bit more of willy nilly by fast action where are limits is station actually works alone with more on the semantics a word in order to find the pure root of work rather than chopping off the
and so light the way i understand it i could be wrong is that limit to station is a more pure sophisticated but computation expensive version of standing so stems and lamas then within the world of tokens we have another thing called and it's distance now we're getting a little bit into the territory of algorithms machine running out of bounds at a distance is how different two words or from each other so let's say caps and car there deferred
by one word so in a simple way you can consider them and at a distance of one so you might use at a distance for example in spell checking for spelling correction or google might use at a distance in suggesting were were you misspelled it's okay so let's just the list of these little small bits odds and ends on an l. p. we've got core pour out which is lists of documents they're sort of related to each other in some way
it's about maybe one corpus is about news another court this is a list of books better public domain like moby dick anything by shakespeare etc another corpus maybe a whole bunch of chat room or kites so pore pore over lists of documents documented this tax blobs dawkins can paint hawkins which are words and punctuation other things and you can operate on tokens in order to change their more fallen g. in whatever way see journey
aides for your machine learning tasks with islam accusation or standing removing stop words etc okay now we move on up the ladder you're at the bottom working with tax pre processing nor moving up the ladder to this middle tier i call tasks were operating on the structure on sentence structure using machine learning algorithms last we're using machine learning algorithms and these tasks primarily relates to
syntax simply working with grammatical structure of sentences like i said these tasks will feed into the ultimate goals high level goals and other animal p. so on this level we have us a category called information extraction information traction extracting information from the sentence structure one such information that we can extract is cold parts of speech he oh that's the hardest
each tagging parts of speech or the roles that individual words play with in a sentence so now owns verbs adjectives et cetera very simple i'm sure you understand this right out of the get go now part of speech to hiding is simple to understand conceptually but can get quite complex with computer has to do the task of part of speech typing and so we use machine learning algorithms such as the market models
and maximum entropy models books that sees next episode in order to automate part speech tagging pos part beach taking another type of information extraction is relationship extraction let's say we have a sentence like apple was invented by steve jobs we have a relationship there we have steve jobs inventing apple so you would have a relationship where invents is sort of like a method name in it takes in parentheses to arguments one being
steve jobs in the other being apple so relationship extraction can extract within the sentence what things relates to other things and how another very important piece of information extraction is called names and steve recognition and he are named entity recognition this is actually a very very important piece of an l. p. i used in your pretty heavily at my last job in an l. p. any art is vital for things like chaff
watts c. yuri google assistant to the center of what any organized is it looks it your sentence at it takes out salient parks things that you're interested in the end so if you ask siri had lunch with john to my calendar on may fifteenth you'll read the sentence and it'll figure out who what when where it'll pick out the important parts launch john may fifteenth case of other entities in the sentence wunsch
john and may fifteenth and then they will name those entities launch his watts okay so what name goes to launch who is john and when is may fifteenth and then any are typically also corresponds with another bit which is intent extraction sweep lot of that the intent to being a adding something to what hollander so we're talking this theory that push a button and i firmly say siri avalon
with john on my calendar for may fifteenth because the it translates speech to tax that's a whole other piece of an l. p. speech to tax id parsons the sentence that may use part of speech tagging combined with syntax tree parsing etc in order to perform a slightly higher goal of names and stuart ignition and eat our perform the task of pulling out of that sentence he says they're important in order to purr
form an action that pulls out an intense that is the action that is add something to a calendar to add to calendar is the intent for the method name open parentheses and then it passes in these arguments these names entities lunch john may fifteenth close parentheses executes the action them so named as the recognition is is a vital piece of an l. p. parsing specifically syntax streetcar
sing parsing teases out of the sentence the structure of the sentencing overall structure of sentence is very related to part of speech tagging part of speech saying is figuring out which rolled each individual workplace noun verb adjective well parsing does the same famed bow with larger chunks these are called constituents and builds into which free so high is slowly have a sentence in you
break that down maybe over on the left we have a noun phrased in lower right we have overworked phrase the boy with blond haired jumped into water on the left we have been known phrase being the boy with blond hair and on the right we have the verb phrase being jumped into the water and they can break those down on the left we have the boy with blond hair okay so boy is a noun and with blond hair is a proposition all phrase if you just keep breaking the senses do
our dna hierarchical format tonight sri structure until we eventually get to pee oh that's part of speech had it so parsing it is a hierarchical structure old grammatical approach a higher level approach and pos part of speech typing is a low-level approach work work work whereas parsing is a tree structure grammatical parsing of the sentence okay so the role of things that i consider
tasks of course these tasks are based on the parks in order to perform pos part speech tank or eighty or named any recognition or relationship extraction or parsing we first have to pre process are taxed by feeding into adult court this or document token eyes a man document steadier limits raising those tokens removing stop words etc okay now we move up the ladder to the top the high level lofty goals
an l. p. the reason for which we have the tasks blow was there with a simple example of an ultimate goal of an elk he spell checking and spelling correction a pretty solves task if you ask me any we've had spell check sense microsoft word of the nineteen nineties spell check may depend upon grammatical structure in order to determine what is billed most likely word you're dealing with but you can easily think of spell
check as simply working with at a distance that i mentioned before see aka tak will maybe you meant to say car were kept find some word which is all of minimal and it's distance then what the user intended to write an edition of clark or cat which is the most likely word the user intended given the sentence they've written thus far so spell checking is maybe it's simple goal come out
number one classification text classification we already talked about text classification with classifying e-mails as either spam or not spam busy buying eerie classification task and remember the machine learning power over them we use barely is naive days indeed naive days is a very popular out revenues in the world of an l. p. s or get to in the next episode so weevil are
talked about classification and you artie understand basically what classification is all about you haven't document and you trying to classify it is this that or the other thing related to classification or i might even grid hundred classification is sentiments an analysis determining whether what's being expressed in a document is positive or negative or maybe even more complex he might break it down into all of you rainbow the motion second the exterior
it's angry sad happy nervous scared et cetera for the most part applications of sentiment analysis no real world tend to be relegated to positive and negative emotion common use cases of sentiment analysis are determining whether a movie reviews are positive or negative see him come up with the overall sentiment about the movie made ill scrape these all from twitter are in facebook et cetera you don't have at your disposal monsieur
early star ratings well sent him in alice's skin below the more complex than you think sarcasm can exist in a sentence which could turn of the apparent sentiments of what's being said upside down or certain words which would usually be associated with positively like fantastic or excellent can be modified to flip the sentiments being expressed that movie was fantastically haw
and then we was not excellence sentiment in alice's is used for urgent harmony overall sentiment towards a product or or a company or other such things there are high frequency trading algorithms alvare which hearts the fire hose of social media in order to determine the overall sentiment towards a product in order to decide whether to invest in that product it's very interesting so sends an analysis has very
high value in business it's that sense analysis showcases very effectively the growing history of an l. p. in general the past would have said no he was primarily based on hard coated rules pulled from the history of linguistics so we might just simply look for words like excellent or bad or four more happy were wonderful like that said sarcasm or ma fireworks might mock that up till then we move on to mush
you learn move from we moved from heart coated systems to machine learning systems like naive days and then bag of word approach it's those get us closer to the gold but they still have problems we still are not over calm sarcasm or ma fires we may eighteenth hole in the system that words like not preceding the motive word we actually then be calm one word not underscore good but that still feels a little bit
i am holding feature engineering and we have to sort of knoll the feature engineering baby-sit take place in order to work with these documents soul state of the yard sentimental says his move us towards deep learning deepening uses things like work for your own networks which will read the sentence left to right and sort keep were running tally accounting for ma fire words and sarcasm and all those things while still learning
pull up for sale in words and patterns in senses senate announces very important pretty complex watson machine learning algorithms used here varying from sdn support back to machines hit markoff models naive days rucker neural networks will talk about all that later another category of classification document classification is to hiding documents that is different from classifying documents classifying documents it
giving it one class in any number of classes acute be a buyer classification and his spam detection work in the mall tino will classification the case of sentiment in ounces but hanging alternately known as topic modeling or keyword extraction is actually figuring out what keywords to apply to this document any to be any number of key words so if we're looking at some programming blog post on the internet him
i'd ask be talking about no j. s. and reacting reacts native and post grass and all these things so it's going to learn to tag this document with all of these tactics us away think above top model it is the machine learning approach to automatically to hiding blog post which you see all over the internet already have tags are manually tags well in certain instances we don't have luxurious manual typing maybe were scraping documents from some corpus and we want to bottom
i play tag them to the week present that as a library of documents that people can sift through by category the common elber the news there is awake and your chalet at our location the old d. a. okay another lofty goal of an elk he is search search engines finding relevant documents of document relevance as well as document similarity how similar are documents to each other so searches really adia
to tighten at query and find relevant documents a popular algorithm used here is called t. f. i. d. f. common frequency inverse document frequency and document similarity is all about how similar one document is to another so for example in a recent cable competition remember cable is a competition board of machine learning it asks where a team of machine learning programmers can compete with another team and maybe for cash cry
is for employment opportunity etc the recent competition posted by cora the website core of cue you or gate which is a question in sir website similar to stack overflowing the like of the competition like this one a user is asking a question that hiding in a title and it's hiding in a description with their question on the core website they want to be able to find similar documents automatically and present those journalists format on the right
sidebar so the user can see if their specific question is has already been asked and answered in the past so they're not submitting a duplicate question so as the task of documents similarity again a common algorithm here would be t. f. i. t. f. r. right let's get a little bit deeper let's talk about natural language understanding now natural language honor standing or an alley you by comparison to natural in which processing
the general field of an elk here we've been talking about last far the sub field within the machine learning of everything related to language that's an l. p. natural language of understanding is holing out of what's being said in a sense the semantics now we have symantec's holing out of them need the intent of us sentence somebody asks a question you have to have natural language understanding you know
urge to answer that question well i said the case of machine translation you have to understand the i'm betting were being coding people were all intents of the sentence in english in order to translate it to its equivalent in spanish so natural language understanding or an l. u. is all the tasks of an elk heed their require a fundamental understanding of the sentence for the word that whoa
hey so common tasks with the natural language understanding what i said question at the answering soaps yuri and ghouls assistance they answer questions if you ask a question you will answer the likeness of the four if you type in a global search query in the form of a question who will actually answer your question that obviously they extremely difficult task in an l. p. i actually don't know the algorithms at play here and try to do some brief
church before my next episode see if i can address which used state of the art in the field of question answering but it's i mean is obviously a very difficult task but requires natural language understanding another thing is textual entail meant as interesting problem is if i say one thing does it imply another thing if you read some bit about donald trump winning the presidential election and then you ask the system a question is donald trump the president issued
no the answer is yes because it can do some sort of processing about the parts of the facts that party knows in order to address the question is being asked is related to question answering have a lot to do with logic tax will entail meant and finally of course machine translation machine translation they call this a guy a complete it's an interesting phrase the i complete what it means is this task machine translation requires all the pieces
c. of ai to work in other words once you've achieved perfect machine translation one maybe could say you've achieved ai well if he asked me we've got some darn good machine translation systems out there by google study art and levy's worker neural networks so have we achieved ai well it's always a moving target hampshire somebody's out there saying no no no but traditionally they've always considered machine translation to the end ai complete problem require
ring of all the pieces of that ai to work completely at least within the space of an l. p. machine translation requires all lots of pieces all lot of components we require parsing we require pos we require a handful algorithms like a shannon's and naive days we've got to encode the meaning and intents of what was said on the left hand side so we can translate it into something on the right hand side tries
waiting list to spanish machine translation is also an excellent example of the power of deep learning because like i said in scholl learning approaches we use dogs in gobs of algorithms where indeed learning approaches you can use one algorithm like the mighty worker in neural network which gives you increase simplicity elegance and yea even accuracy next step we have a natural language generation this is that
to leave generating taxed matches parsing tax we're not in putting tax only we can also output tax golf course natural language generation machine translation would be what those examples another example of beach hat box cat box holding a conversation with you series and google assistants tablets used any number of components within an elk he like an easy or for example a very simplistic chat by my take why
you said compare it to a database of conversations and find the most probable response utterance didn't hire sentenced to a throwback actually k. you say a sentence and when the database of conversations it has its disposal defines the most probable sentence full sentence to a throwback catch you at the simple chap by a cool and complex chat baht will
actually generate a sentence were for work they want to throw you a sense in the database it will all end co what you said using natural language understanding and indeed code word by word or a probable response using proper natural language generation that chap officer very fine work with there is a a huge uptake in chap box in the world say i'm sure you've noticed companies are going to have bought wild there is
it's a push for the concept called you why free or no we you wire know you ax any number of things that the boy they're trying to say is companies are trying to build a chapel i'll answer that your interacting with the chap by either verbal a war on your keyboard and a chaplain is so good performing actions that you don't need menus and buttons and slider isn't hobbles you'll need a good you wax you'll be us at all all you need to chat
a series of push towards us direction so this is kind of his id eyes of an l. p. in today's generations chap octopi think they're confining you know i i think it up properly donna you jerk spurious is going to allow users to perform actions so much faster than fighting it's a bunch of tax on a keyboard so i don't know how this chap walk freezes and handouts whether it's gonna be a bottle or whether it can be successful will see another apple
asian of natural language generation is the image captioning now are boring between the image of people in the natural language people were combining our efforts in order to perform a combined task of image captioning and so you see this from time to time i don't remember facebook in caption images for excessive ellie purposes for blind users that weber who's doing this but this is somebody on o. capturing images for excessive billy
on the reverse ghoul is translating search crews into the damages they represent an if you actually use google photos you can search in your own surf box on earth on some phrase and it will actually bring up for you images that look like that phrase it's pretty cool so image captioning an image searching the condor reversing each other than that image captioning zen example of natural language generation we see it in the image and actually does
cried zeke image word by word automatic summer is a sham this is a very useful and powerful task also very difficult an example of automatic summers asian it in use today is summarizing legal lee's summarizing legal documents so for example how cool would be if the website with privacy policy or terms of use contract emina we reso's sings half the people don't read them because they just don't care sure what everyone is at the service
but maybe the other half wants to read these documents to the so long and it's still have the time to read every privacy policy and terms of service under the sun well at the good automatic sunrise or might be able to boil down a privacy policy into the most important it's sort of a reader's digest or an abstract of privacy policy automatic summers asian is in use today in summarizing actual legal documents for
legal purposes i believe gould one answer your question at the top of the search results uses automatic summarizes the figures out how to sunrise and answered your question without showing you too much taxed all what's natural language generation okay some other odds and ends on aka really cover the algorithms that play optical character recognition or o. c. r. is being able to convert case stands documents from a physical bookworm
physical paper into digital format golf course the primary algorithm at play of an optical character recognition system is indeed the convolution own neural network c. n. n. or consonant an algorithm we're going to discuss we talk about the image recognition that primary algorithm of image recognition is the conde nast of course that's going to be at play in converting the damage into dijon format by certain letters
maybe incorrectly translated and so an elk he will come into play in order to figure out baby in one word were given the second's thus far was the most likely letter for this mistake so both c. r. is another example of a marriage between the image people in the language people and then of course we have speech speech by whole author or ball game that speech to text text speech when you talk to siri ver
or bully it converts what you said early to tax because series reads from tax and then serious response your query with tax and your phone read that back to you with speech so converting from speech to text and back is a whole world its own or you have to analyze wave frequency in structure of audio files of all those things were aka talk about speech
this is a couple buzz words for you there segmentation is figuring out how to choke a body o'flaherty maybe segmentation in two sentences for example and another thing is called a dire realization di id or by easy t. t. i o. and dire realization and the gold there is a nation is to figure out in an audio file let's say we have a conversation between one person another person and i ate a customer service representative any customer
or even at a dialogue between multiple parties the recording of low companies need dire is asian is all about separating the audiophile into the speakers so speaker a. said the following shot speaker be said the following chalk speaker a again saying the following talks of school dire as they should so speech to the whole world its own involving audio processing which i know nothing about and so i won't be talking about
in this context okay a giant lay of the land of an l. p. we went from the bottom where we talked about little odds and ends like core porn and documents and tokens how to operate on tokens like wanted to station and stemming removing stop words finding word similarity with and it's distance we talked about syntax and semantics syntax being parsing sentence structure such as part of speech tagging relationship that track
ten and syntax sri parsing those role in that middle tier according to the high were three car parts tasks and goals semantics is all about word meaning sentence meaning document meaning etc pulling the underlying meaning of all we're whether it's contents jules similarity in the case of work to that there were enough talk about a third part of this series document similarity using t. f. i. d. f. etc so we had death
second tier of tasks primarily relating to syntax parsing that includes information extraction such as pos any your that's part of speech taking named angie recognition and relationship extraction as well as syntax tree parsing there we go toward third tier of the lofty goals of an elk heed such as spelling checking in correction document classification is well it's document sentiment analysis and hiking with top modeling
or keyword attraction classification search document relevance stocky man similarity natural language of understanding tasks that question and shrink textual entailed and machine translation natural language generation such as the image captioning chap box and automatic summers asian and o. c. r. and speech in the next episode all talk about the algorithms but if you wanna get started on that before that episode comes out
unwarranted talk about the resources now first the resources for learning natural language processing have really done my best to boil it down to booth most fundamental resources natural language processing is mine jam is my particular specialty within machine learned it's my favorite topic and so i think that these are the three best resources out there is a text book called speech and language processing by daniel drafty he is sort of that
the andrew being of an l. p. daniels raspy also co authored by james martin then there is a and help e. u. tube series by a daniel drafty again which is basically the u. tube series equivalent to that textbook what's nice about that is that the speech and language crossing textbooks and probably a thousand pages the penalty u. tube series goes pretty quickly i think it's twenty four hours
and convert its audio and that's what i suggest is you converts audio like usual were i talk about my video recommended resources what i usually do is converted to n. p. three put on my ipod andrew on running are claiming zara all host the how to convert the videos u. m. p. three things on my resources page was called the stanford and l. p. series on youtube finally there is a library how they're called an l. c.
hey natural language tool kit is far away at the most popular and it helps the library used by professionals is on it is written on python and it comes with capability for handling all of the things that we've discussed in this episode from ole ole to the high so it calms of all those tax free processing methods such as tokenism sherlock says asian stemming etc it comes with math
as for part of speech hanging that's the recognition that sarah and then a cons of algorithms as well for classification of documents a military and the like now technically it is insufficient for going the distance you can write a search engine using an l. t. k. you wouldn't write each hat box or a machine translation system using an l. t. k. instead penalty kate is a very useful tool kit the u.
tell the belt all library i like to think of it if you know java script is still low dash of natural language processing for those schools that python developers are hard pressed to not use it in their natural language greer no matter what final solution you're not planning on that typically like i said the lofty goal in the middle of deep learning ricardo networks and we're to that that's ten sir floor pie tortured him using these deep learning fling works blight you'll still find an old he came very handy for
or tax pre processing are accessing a court it's is all that popular court cora available just a method away now what's interesting about an l. t. k. the resembling ineptness freezer section is they have written a book and i'll teach hate got work for words slash block that isn't warmly about penalty k. is primarily about an elk he did penalty kate book which is for free and aids and h. t. m. o. format is cry
merrily intended to teach you can help feed in general just using an l. t. k. as a vehicle and in fact many professors intercourse is a sign the n. l. t. k. book as they're reading assignments so you can either do this speech in line with processing text book which is very gay and more theoretical or you can go the way of the n. l. t. k. book which is more hands on and practical and faster if you want to
a common and l. p. experts don't recommend a speech in line with causing an l. c. k. book but if you wanted to sort of get a quick label lands were just hit the ground running don't recommend the penalty cable i knelt c. k. that library it calm there are alternatives out there as well open an l. p. n. stanford n. l. p. is we're all different libraries that you can use for shallow learning machine learning algorithms usually in the space of machinery you're going to be grand
being in too deep learning for more powerful flexible and elegant models so you probably can it be moving on to something like ten sir flow or pie torch that's it for this episode alien land of an l. p. m. the next episode the second part of the series i'm going to talk about the show learning algorithms traditional models use in an l. p. now my friends have terrible news for you in order to continue working on this pie cass i'm going to have to take on advertisers i know of
dean of every pot house listeners life but i've reached that point in listener ship were actually have the download weren't can start reaching out to advertisers to sponsor the show and so i'm hoping that you guys can actually go to my website goes to belgacom force life pod casts forward slash machine learning where i'm going to post a user survey is required in order to sign up for sponsorship with lives in the pike pass who sings service by e.

's fellow that user form for me i know that
insults injury to do me a favor few good and so sorry please i'm also going to try to make my website little bit more useful were maybe all pose announcements for what i plan to pose nude episodes for example this episode was two weeks later i apologize for that i had to collect some resources on this topic so hopefully i can add some incentive for pop in motion the website okay guys thanks for listening siu next time


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash m. l. g. eight and i'm also starting a new contacts which can use your support and it's called last year's like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. welcome back to machine applied in this episode i need to be interviewing co workers from that matters
that expert in architecture and your watch is an expert in dialogues were developer operations these two skills combined into deploying of a full fledged products they can be used by consumers awhile back on mobile lab most of what we've talked about miss park s. series this machine learning how to develop and train your model inside the darker container or even developing in training your models on the cloud by way of
the dub us siege makers studio no books now our skill sets are on the machine running side but eventually why did that model into the hands of a customer after you have train your model whether on local host or on stage maker you'll deploy your model through sage maker today sage maker rest and points or two way model registry they can be called as safe maker batch transform jobs or sage may
kirk server was infringed jobs so now you have your deployed machine learning mall ready to be used but who's been the use it as we're all the stuff from this episode comes in now i'm noah have talked about whole lot of the tooling and concepts from this episode in the past and i promise i'm knocking attorneys bypass series into a false back slash architecture slash dow bob's pod cast and it's actually war and bring us up so that i wanted to talk to my colleagues who are experts in the fee
gold stock bomb going my way through these episodes waste year guises time and just say hey messenger was let's nail kaufman far do you do this as a machine learning engineer how do you product eyes and deploy your machine learning model as a full product in the cloud should you do that now to get you thinking along that track i want to talk about my journey with no fee no seed was inspired by the publication inaccessibility of the
transformers and opie models hardy face repository of all these models summers asian question answering i thought you know these would be really great for use in a journal apt to get people recommendations and resources and see what a couple of crack my knuckles candidate typing away by deploy these models previously as doctor containers running on a dub us that now i'm moving everything over to the dead us age maker onstage maker you can deploy models that you train or you can deploy preach
rain models as rest and points or for use in the server was in france jobs great now that i had a machine running model had figure out how to get that users of the day custard journal in the next step was to deploy a case server are using python fasted the eyes to a dub us the sea astro lasted container services and wrapper on a. b. c. 's that makes it easier to work with his call for gate forty will manage the scaling up then
down of your darker beasts servers based on loaded on the server great malin have a server but i knew database so i created a a dub us or d. s or relational database services host grass database and i had to create and i pay them a roll attach that to my forget container smith has access to my party yes database then i had to make for good accessible from some others
chirps namely the front to talk about and that so i a spa not an application low bouncer or a l b that has an ikea just the iq dresses registered as a domain name on a route fifty three in aid of us fight that bail be to my four gates service now the whole thing is accessible by i p. address finally i needed a fright and so that the users can write their journal entries in communicate with the server and servers in a kick off this
each make or model inference jobs to ephron and was written in reacts that is java script beach tim allen c. s. s. and then i dropped the bill the artifacts of that react code base in shoes and asked for reebok gets us three is the l. u. s.'s service for storing files with industry you can check a box made this bucket publicly accessible as a web site now few warrior esrey bucket to be a public website but thousand stop there you actually have to do in others
and that is to put a what's called cloud for its distribution over your bucket but far from distributions gold is to cash those files of various locations around the world so that it's more fast lead accessible by users in various locations that conference purpose but it's actually required stat if you want added domain name again through route fifty three star register domain name no c. dot ai point it's a record so that cloud frontage b. c.
far from distribution points to the ash tree bark at best reebok its files are reacts transcripts yes as a steam out there making baby i calls to my forty container through the application load bouncer the forty containers sitting on top of the c. s. which is managing the scaling up and down above that service the forty container has attached to it and i am policy begins access to the database on r. d. s and afar gave container will make calls too
the sage maker model and points in order to ron inference jobs using machine learning all and did i mention your washing all this stuff up yourself by pointing and clicking your way through the dub u. s. consul the reason for that is it's hard to track changes of your architecture overtime or snow what services you have running in which ones are affiliated with each other or less say you make a change in your keep track of that change we want to keep track of that change unless
all less stuff is stored in cold as a as a project i'm using called care reform perform it is what's called infrastructure as code it lets you manage all of the deploying all of your quads services in a cold file you can check in that file to get up and then you can use our file to track changes to your architecture or time or so that other users can repeat that architecture on their hands or so that you can make subtle changes in let's say your product dad and staging in bar
once just by way of code so i just mentioned a slew of cloud hosting services on eight of us and how you'd do that in code and it is your head spinning because mine is this so that was the impetus for this episode was that the last year's worth of bumbling my way through architecture n'dour box when my specialty is machine learning and davis and says i'm sure is the case for most of my listeners want to get some back spur
tom online and say what are the popular tools out there in which schools should be being used for all of these skills valuable to the machining engineer or expected of the machine learning engineer or in the job market should we be bothering with this stuff or is it too big a pill the swallow and we should be leading instead on a par dell vox colleagues or hiring somebody to do this for us is so that's the kicking off point for this episode i hope you enjoy one
max's show today we're into good-bye gertrude and read talk about that box or developer operations and architecture and we have on the show to co workers from doubts matt merrill of new jersey solve the imam arrow i'm a director of engineering at the u. s. icon from aback around about sludge on the development and no just the boatman tides dabbled in dialogue said something about won't we usually the guy me out to you is he's reaching across the aisle to need be ops books and things like that i bid you know
for fifteen years into a puppeteer by my baby's blood which idea i am de de la scott does lead at that i start out my career as a job on parole python poll rehmer and i was doing double us before is that from the wild scheme out because of my varied interest i would always said cockpit oscars allied unity ministry should i would always do the c. i. a. c. p. jenkins because no one in them
wanted to do it no was made to the dead servers again because no one to do it and i started to automation all-star abdication because i do wanna do by hand and i learned that while performed and sibyl look this selective in my career from job the development to the box so for our listeners a promise on our return showing to dubach slash architecture show or false that had been taking another direction about monsieur up so's
carcass age made thirty of us but this might be the last episode where talk about that lots of condom bumbling no way through dialogue steinhauer awaits to machine learning for anybody in machinery to actually belongs to deploy their models to the cloud for quiet they wanted their model online but in this episode were cut willing tile down dialogues between huge use what is it the place into the machine and ecosystem whether you'd been developing models on sage may burn your local whoa stands now reward betting on
wine so regard to the experts here sure what's going to disturb them lots mask and talk about architecture received our does that fit into the picture from she murmured in perspective so you're alive what is that lots sold a is a philosophy and uphold that the dead that bob store together to the help deploying cold and applications safer quicker into production soul it may be good to highlight zone
the problems that the boss tried is gonna solve originally and then still happens today the beds and aunts even though they both were keeping biology and they both were missing company they don't talk to each other to silo and we see that numerous conceded now when that there's an engagement so don't also weighed june have the common colds in common communication process so that way east to silas can work together well and as you know we go wanted to apologize to be part but some specific cool
within some specific processes that that makes the mob's work yeah so low on my own blisters early sino on sheena mean coworkers are calling this impasse then i'm doing is you they write a model or mobile coaster using cancer floor kara sir pike for such a large ideally often though be using a darker contain i'm so if they're on a map that all have a daughter container the ron's machinery not to be able use g. p. because of mathematicians if they're using windows they might be passing through to dub us all to
by way of darker and writing machinery models who might be using or doctor container and insurance fromm andy and containers were hiding fish containers more often the case were icy is people or writing their models on a slide to burn no books in a cloud so will create a g. c. p. were a ws account and they'll all go to the machine learning tool kit sony ws it's called sage maker they opened sage record it creeps for them a juggernaut
run off the bat open up that no but they started impact on toad the right i'm on all there are they're using care off the train and ended them when they deploy it save maker has all the stewing for deploy amalia same all but a ploy and you'll do all suffer you background the wold spin up kronos b. c. two instances yes as instances we all know exactly sometimes using darker than you're hearing from pacific are dark and inert sometimes it does all that country recision for you itself at all you'd
who's rates and python protocol debris rosebud what happens is machinery and using nope jupiter the race a python they deploy oman all the rest was like where we go from your heart we make that available to be done next to your clients in ames that's kind of where are we stopping upon cast and you began as a summer is an expert in the orchestration wham yes so that's a great dead requesting 'cause i actually experienced this first head so what
working with the team which bobo telematics c. a t. the dead which he led a team they were out playing around with siege maker did not understand boss of the dead body and what became the likud's pyramid if he were really popular to analyze speed up process data is played ada sold one day be cheated me you say date we got this disease maker in that of them knew what to put production and i did delay the bus age major i barely knew anything about
jupiter nobles and that they knew was sucked out i'll call you why for python that is going you about a soul know what the dialogues velocity is collaboration right the debts and aunts working together to shiva common going to put so it was a two way street so they caught me about jupiter no books siege major things a bad egg on my end you know it took a look in their bed the implementation and i saw all what they said had to be modified before we could deploy to production with it
i'm right this cop it is so complex that were not expecting wish he would dance to understand it is so just give some examples i had to be could be desk because it had you should be done in there was a hard core the database use the passwords on there so we had to be seized in court i am execution rolls to us in short annual get access to that the database seekers measure to retrieve the sea shooting password and make backups in case things crash
so there's a bad things that you have to do it for good production and that's why you would work with your de los ti eap to do that we're not expecting the dentist to think about all the stuff that has to go before court production actually know the macey ta da imam you contrast secrets manager ashley what is architecture imagine trying an honest was architecture how sad differ from dialogues imagine islamic crossover so mad you'll sperling architecture juror appeals paroling them ups you always are
as rolls some are different shepherd is one be any other hand yet but it doesn't interest aggression of actually never heard of belov some architecture computer dwight abbott was star was what i think architecture it's not step back by saying wait you know beers's perception of the guns off for engineering not an architect is gonna wake up some kind of amending the stone age you click god like figure who sits on an ivory tower and sends down yuck spur our team needs to build an sob and then there certainly are those the market tax but i think about spry
with the worst i'd move toward the court the kicker possibly house icy architecture arrows assistance it in howl different systems and tractor to each other they and how okay and you made a healthy whole system that is as simple as you possibly to make it maybe each individual peace is complicated within itself by how are you going to make all those different things in your business talk to each other whether it be the customer relations
management system feeding d. deck into your machine learning model or whatever it might be how are those things going to play nicely together how're you going to make shore about your teams of people with their rates skill sets to support those things thinking back far ahead thinking about how all these applications are going to get deployed and making for that you do how to ago bob see more crowded during team or whatever you wanna call it becomes
or that type of stuff i was with the given us across coming technical person who news at the service both different teams who could help connor road map these things i really like the discussion you into juror or how they did your one mentioned about what we can expect wish you learning a junior to know all the stops became rightly it's it's unfair it's it's on talkback it's that spot on the need at least one person to stop or people to do so do things the latest into the role of architecture in sky
of the person you could take a step back or people back and take a step back and think about hope all all this one's together before it goes out to you susan i would say that most small companies you windstar with an architect but would you start getting bigger that's when you need to start to cuba having somebody in their role in an ideal you have somebody grow into that role organically who how's although the context in history and things like that always commonly comes from a full stacked knows how to surprise today big stars the guest on how
get 'em all okay then excesses so am i right to satan architects blueprints whole thing and added them ops makes it happen that we snuck while the nets for my confusion was a slip out of that those two rolls of somewhere in the way that the applauds would string the services together actually in implementation still a big just depends on the architect and their expertise soul i'd go with new respected architects from numerous to three clients and companies some architects are there
recyclable right abroad diagram is able to we have a dictator the senate for miss mead fine lines up high we needed clustered we need to have noticed wold is security here here's a diagram the box you fake iraq the committee should get to work on their luck architects specially built for promoted from the trenches okay well i want all of this and this is how i wanted rape by white guilt for gate and i want couldn't eddie's you or whatever cool to the light he is the recipe
you just follow when so just as an architect and the skill sets and the personalities but i like to think that the law or effect of architects are somebody knows when to do read tableau springs upper right time do you not you'd you don't always want the blueprint because you might have an effective team i do because as much you know part of science and also just human interaction as typical work sell it inclusion in is that's hey xiang damn box as a role as a
she learning in junior is to be looked old school if you know one man band a project as machine mining engineer maybe for a client would say it's a one machine an engineer who just when it a client who may or may not have other people working on the project taking on a bunch of del box technical know how would be a lot to ask because in a way it's a it's a role in it's own rights it's not just the suite of skills it's a doll
rubles for any technical person to have on or about stow your watch that that being said to me speak to serve all levels complexity wolf's been doing dialogues on wine may be a machine an engineer wouldn't want to take on all this burn themselves right so it specially security is the one that's curious rate especially with mushy wording you're probably gonna be touching since the day diana was insisted says sedate out so in this state is exposed whoa
the bad times for you that country are quite a bit coppinger working for the back wait you probably want to hire a professional to take a look at your implementation and in oak your dad's the specializing that to make sure that the application that you wrote your laptop can be deep lloyd quickly safely repeatable each huge production insecurities potable supporting we did twenty eight clients where it is not just the application to the cbc chirp this battle in the car
infrastructure to write this didn't work you see plenty a kind word to them work is called a dyke he wide open to the world easily hackl notice these things called as the blockage we use the steuer data that's all been sold securities the one thing where it pays double potential come in and take a look and tied down cool jury when i'm curious we do is but i would say that everything you said is spot on what that is not so good at what every bias on them now and you're to try to die didn't you
not hardly but i think that there are certain things that animal engineered can do in certain skills as a big instructor bro shop on bellow position but m. l. project well to be taken over by adam upstate and i think we're going in and talk about some of those that some curious big bad rings true if you as well since i nodded about oxford discounted it's on my periphery soul usually what i've seen is a powerful is pretty easy to take a break
oh where there's an aisle or dennis is all take a look railroad this turf war to spin up the guy d. c. today to be seeping it is fair for me to look at school and i'm glad we did it issued its learned that baby had the better for her to marge bolsa know put on the right settings inside that soul i think it's great that they need the learns doctor carrick for an answer bowl where it is but it still requires a collaboration today get professional big organizations did it
the club based on the trigger point in him back to old you're into church and about lots to m. l. n. junior shouldn't think that they're just imitate isn't taken over the fence to the lobsters and be downloaded on the balance for soon as the magically hoof make this appeared production there's been a beach in twos and conversations going both ways been ordered him a backpack in collaboration is beat you to double ops working together to to shiva common goal that said that stuff is something that's going to highlight colburn over this conversation
architecture cliburn with the box in the dow box and doesn't it would work together to a new engine ridge utility hands in move the land which the bill you have a single into chartreuse carl you know what the two largest dive into the tooling and i have a juror wants talking for now it's your hand he's got really good looks to be the journey through the history aunts and one spires the creation in use of the school's soldier rock doug's going to join so we'll get into the landscape
bobby's them up stools but it is really important to remember we just talk about like this is a full-time job right we're in a ghost rue all these different types of tools so that you how to live away and you can hear these ability out as the configuration management tool donna we're not suggesting you go into deep dive in any of these this is so you can talk to your dubach steeple communicate with them better or just key role to be a little bit more intelligent and osgood
questions when these topics come on so listen to it sure what's that expert in you know wannabes areas in he's gonna greed greed greed or reviews in and out of lead most to details follow your head into sherman reliable concepts and you're gonna be a really really gucci all right so were the goggle back loaded to the old days ago days where the bad old and it's cried the problem that the mob's is dryness all four have stalled for a double
hard so i don't days there are people would go way back to the u. why does look pretty good to be in crete servers and create a porch would apartments or do whatever they need to do it would do it manually that is colors are on the u. s. consul website or he'd been given before a dub us forget the 'em where you have had the honour command lines rape even with fizzle servers people would go with log on to disturb there and this had been commenced many only so assault was a good dark c.
hundreds of helping to be done balkans are configured ending with daddy g. dear laughter that office last raid and all that no documentation no idea what that person did it's hard to do a managerial potential business that way no way related issue on house that was a mass just a god what's going on and the serb or this trash will look for that but the and then you know what the classic settle we see all the time is okay one dead or one ad man goes into one severed does it what
wait a minute and it goes into another summer doesn't know the way you know this was the right message that deferred to break into star burst into boxes sold the manual towards a call box you to operate soul would go bob's it was take some of the velocities of deb rape you have cold that you're right you have cold that you can read you into an old to milly checked into local repository get selway is a record of the changes is a record of what
didn't and he in and all the people can run it sold it seems like a pretty basic concepts now but when it was first introduced again she injured and knows a lot of resistance to write almost wiped out all your try to take over my job so what infrastructure is cold those is the schools like confirmation terror for holding the bag well instead of you going into debt eagerly was cause we're going to be cut to be to create a server to create siege maker
you can write cold to do what they could be could be in the den would you would check the dead and is yet to make changes then you could make that change in cold review with two teams in all we're gonna change instance to you know m. l. m. five large took them five x. large check again when it and you'd see the history of what happened to have a code file and spit deploys all the aid of the u. s. infrastructure for it without which is your clutches run some screw
it's an old spin out all your nice to your data bases are so with this infectious code does yes and all the game changer was what i mentioned before we get through the differed off to the digs differently now that he had called you can we run this cold in another environment rape by discussing a terrible would say you ran this coat and death you tested out there was some blows with the infrastructure happens and then you know after what you got okayed this works she could take one to one that cold passed it
able to wait or crawl on an exact same thing will happen to weigh in chronically short would be tested down it seems to where we testing to us in prague and in that old days else i'd guarantee that all right the mayor daley to the steps yes to run to deploy a manually the guarantee you know stepan debutante boarded the d. of the wahlberg recently by a deploy service are using tear for us or p. diddy span the working of the the scene at
the b. b. c. block coat was was a new twenty five one to go do it created a bunch of stuff i didn't know i need to create so round table in a game way in or d. c. else always sings i would've known to have donned myself an urge to expose the serbs to yaron he ended up us you see like a picture sure truckers cope with their same the faults also helps with its simplicity of that point architecture oh definitely that's another because it from death
they came into bob's you what did larry the reuse ability all he had this model of all the complex it behind us off ox lapd's pass to prepare a bulls and what do the right thing already mentions constellation turf wanted to meet how to resolve the particular took a confirmation is a baby was specific and had to perform is more generic you could do more to cop out a terror from it is that the most popular in the structures cool cool is the one that if you would think
urge all of us would you should learn gloomy comes in seoul to care for him is very structured in the way was it means this canal was my way or the highway plume he takes that this concept and adds we'll call it good so you wanna go for you in this state men in the more generic you can the so it's a great off he could be more dynamic but at least once they get a cold with gloomy because if you're a cold big get that flexibility it's good i would
that we recommend care reform as it's the most popular and it's double structured it's easy to teach it's easy to not messed up too much also go on over on wine supported the number two has a very very by brick community when i found an early to do it but on of support examples an independently n. before even talk to these guys attendance in conclusion richer for sport or else we'll have to cork
does have a one point four billion dollar i appeal so it's a real company it's not some open-source being the nose and maintain so would you do need perpetual support you can be cut out to have to court or that the court to say okay get this turf war can you help us and skip one cool theater florida as you or mention is that small black clouds were so if if you don't like give us a jews were reporting on this episode you can use turf a g. c. p. and azure and others but in many of us world
there is confirmation and out c. k. if we're solely of us heavy why are we saying turf for over to begin work on rage is so c. t. k. within the debauchery he is a baby intense debate on how do you prefer sure is called the state had one can lead to lay on the table and they were i believe that if the soldiers coolidge be structured you should do a lot old we're dynamic stuff to but doing that polly do sunday
we're on the flight control words care reform and the confirmation is in ways just passed neil bush can configuration and i'll figure out how do it with cold lonely it would seem the tape is taking some of the complaints that structures it will all i wanted to discuss eating or i wouldn't say no if deb you this is prod do that and i wanted more like how i'd call bill bowls c. b. k. of clooney sport type are on supports could scrub acting job was in there too
okay this is a procedural purse declares come right exactly showed have a better form is an aged immobile issue tendency to john skirts are out of jeff's exactly but it's very great analogy performs as this is what must be darned see cases do this we're ready okay so that's good for structures code mr fung on it and gun and friends i've heard a lot or cancel where is that fall into place yes so what the bad to be seen things about the dubach schools is
this big yellow the interest or should call the bank and configuration management in the two different sped casualties and the coolest that as it is for sure caldwell and it wasn't as configuration management well is different cole's different companies soul let me describe what configuration is because as a rural road example and we see this pattern lot you would use care reform to create an easy to server in a tub us and widespread in there
it's easy to server is in the cloud what about you got to put your special this is sauce insured right you got to configure ill you saw security patches you got to add unit users you got to ashley installing your business at what do those pass to reform is not very good at and it so does indicate the cool club and stubble which does that worry that began to configuration you can say okay install this patch no young's
bob had forty three at the next ad uses these ran as wise and then when installed on as each so that what has what does and that's what configuration management that is what you have the generic server the configuration management cool installs your business logic to it to the way it actually work now i will do that with darker right soul a lot of these configured ration mesh the clothes are getting deprecating 'cause they were beside affordable day
east where you would actually have either fiscal server or the brcko serb ready would have a unix server that set up like sleet and you had to go with it and configured soul containers or another game changer in the box where is the old joke will were so my laptop read the doses were so my laptop and offices will assist deployed the laptop when the greetings by containers is that all your laptop you can do it they're beating on your lap kok ready to go ronnie
you did serb are you could test and deployed and the development on that doctor container what you're satisfied that this works on my laptop human combined into a dark image would you just a cold everything and give it to be good about seeing is a ploy it were so my laptop attested take this entire thing and go the other dudes but it is that they start up almost its biggest almost instant its we were as these other methods can take a long time to start up the big deal
the jury is would be doing down is would you do in prague you would run it easy to serb are all your laptop ready to act this coolly to come in make it but doctor dictatorship would go with it was a major gauge featured when ago was first introduced okay so we're out of infrastructures code that is writing a profile although create a whole stack on a dub york's whole stack on she's seeking to pat asked you would walk into the sea two instances that you may have deployed with
configuration mission tools to install the patches on the soccer and you mentioned in seoul what were the other ones were there's a base chef puppet salt bozo that the four main ones and they all have to which he called mind share that big difference between an supple intrepid cub it is that as was the pusher are you run a command for mr burden you push out the configuration with chet to put baby have a peach and on the server in a poor sick
the grecian i'd prefer to push model does to show my bias because i let that control but they are privileged to the same thing that and now all these configuration is rituals are slowly being phased out in favor instead of barker digits you can deploy garden shears crew tariff on to wiki c. s rate for dates and then there's no alternative for daddy is so we have doctor containers now so hard to us about b. c. 's for aid
when eddie's when you use morning news the other one is to run eddie's promised to do everything turf on etc yep so you made a very good point raping so they can support shots are being superseded by a doctor file so that catches you would do it and sibyl and chef in installing an absolute you and ask one just that would just you know darker file and getting allied arkansas again rejected in it's a real father you could pass around seoul cooper daddy's so what you have a duty dirt on your lap top when you get it to
the bosses say the point is that where the real spine b. gans and we can provide a link to decide if miss a cartoon or a diagram were hot be deployed a continued to eight of us this literally fifteen ways to do it would squeeze july confusion and even abbado botsford professionals there's a glut confusion about how about the best deploy eight a darker container and edwin hester old crucial favorites and that we recommend peace yes last the compute of tobacco
i'm busted him to measure rich battle we recommend the professional environment because out of all the options is the easiest it has to that support and cried support but that's it you have a good job osteen if you're just that the one man show inside track runner that's good that simple there is a lasting peace dog that's nice and simple it depends on what you trying kind do and in the big granddaddy of them all as could be dead east and that has a lot of hype ron
the thing that made the onus for us what could be daddy's is it's a berry complex ecosystem to deploy container and people have careers just dedicated to baseball without any other skill sets and they made great money 'cause it's a very complex to get raped and what could be dead east does is it tasted container and that's all the production that used to it right clustering you can employ able to pull containers of local copy
the container away didn't manage go read it there's a pirate users you have two containers inhibit bauza users have three containers for computer specialist security recovered nice to have it does say to talk about the containers or two other extra services and that's just scratch mr fiske what could reduce provides for your own styles the impression it's become keeps with the debate was it is all need higher ups for for orchestration serbs it though all the maid
clouds have doubled implementation of cupboard eddies in aid of the west is card dk yes but at last the company's service and t. c. p. could raise was developed by global selling go cloud that the agent cooper is engine the shore has their own implementation scooby babies and the good thing about these it's called managed services were you could get a cupboard is all your old from scratch right and this is the message blog caught could reduce the hard way the old baby step by step and oddities you would go to buy
and that would either be west of the copper wires that is okay would lead to good eddie's no riders perform that despite dole's read accompanies coaster for you that borsch with all the dog was services does not so much competition is just another way of deploying containers into the crowd and is coming to the most complex way most complex why would we want to see ever since the most complex isolde especially the production loaded you have a really
all of intense production require misled yeah blood of teams in these teams you wanna my course services so you would say you have eighteen containers eighteen different images yet to maintain graced me for that window on at the scaling up and down the world is great for that and to be on a special wanna say parana break so that people will type but the new shiny red was a new toy like to play with his record that the up to the driver in milan architect here at that we sit
write to keep it simple the simpler the better the simpler days is easier to me team you'd manage easier to teach other people so good with babies is opposite of simple big than it should be paid right so accommodating to mere ten commando pretty high salary solo wide as i've seen this so many kinds well i have an opportunity to use cruddy so work i'm a do it because i wanted skill set the other man a bit like just full disclosure i mean
no major gordon is expert on any stretch when i figure this german architectural perspectives i do see go bout stafford i think no one were expressing here is actually one of the hot tape humid about unity but how would you be a certain portion of people were like well we mean not to run eddie's we mean star these yes that i'd get out because we're the advantages of musical burnaby says even though those people to command a premium that skill set is quite available it's also open-source so young couldn't be a more files that you specify for
the money's there been source don't work largely no jury what would you would grow to be honest large we work between different snot manage service providers for good earnings would choose those are nice but it's too but i conclude your re with voyager one as soon as i wish you a good team but ready to do that and ready to deal with the complexities of managing cooper cooper nannies services much better starts about an article about what will occur surgery was granted east and by previous job coogan is plus or read
air raid us so it was the big optical learned and i made soul many mistakes production level was takes inside no permanent volumes security networking it's such a complex caught they did that it's not just maybe will you take all day why did this decor real it works cool you have to deploy the production which we'll users rollover you learn soon enough that is to cold drastically wrong and it's a dildo here doing it hearted debug a
and i'll actually yes annuity it's a mess and fall short of it things go wrong commodities hears all would literally clinic and then just run to the dogwood going on to you said to reduce is is overly complex and now i realize you not just saying that companies to use today's over complex process saying the complexity of the myron you might return orchestrates course on to the complexity of crude many seen use so if you're a start up a sailor and employees he probably
by using only a new as services if your project is wildly complex than your own ones that cool to task which is in the public burdens and it definitely if we both agree is a true that is a is warm decision and make sure that the car to people who've been doubled to one car right to our people or passion about grenade isa production to a cop to dinner too and get their due put on this but it's a huge investment hard to high
eric expensive to hire those almost like a lamborghini right well bloody piece but it's hard to drive you to crash came today that logic works like if you look hot adaptable ever dvd you can use the rearview mirror gosh they had told leonard borden says the book behind it will oblige jamie's but they sure are you know nobody's in the big another thing about grin and i would like to remember that cupboard eddie's was created to help grow and creepy
it's been for structure of the closet google great weight it's inherently warts very complicated like it's gonna be really good but it could be really complicated it's meant for the gloomy scale problems maybe you'd if you're successful up oh my god by hat's off to you you'd be benson complexity and he's a new disarm now but i don't know i don't know find necessarily agree with the stark symbol cured allotted break your wallet to keep using that container so in the star
and with p. c. s and he says is wanted for you pretty far to match point did you ever get to the situation we're while we have cool skill low one hat's off to the youth youth as success you could deathly likely to go buddies are right what is the c. s. c. ok i'm gonna actually honor read this flow chart this maybe we're in audio format and a drop of course all of the images that juror was talking run the show nods for greg what about was weary this platoon see how does this in which a dub
let's come to your shirt show use where you wanna speedier on premise then you to burnett is yes the chaos know the c. s. and an open shift which i've never heard of rosa mina says would you wanna speech here in the cloud both geared to run build jobs could build them that's jobs that she wanted abs scurrilous lincoln still real bogus lambda no find it so brutal slaying know who'll man just ready
the b. to us the other us managed that if he landscape but such an awning and manage it may be doing a lot if you know the myself yes the p. c. to anna says that if she was sort of bolt comes here on promises were in causes green grass i would election thought worked hard wilderness elite curb the mix of currency these yes we have a lot of container services they can use tear we have each a s. b. c. 's way and afar date you start out for
unlike sailed the seas to go dylan bats cyril i'd say the blessing of greek kovach soul even among people who were doing this day in day out to do when we predict what containers it's a complex issue on itself that's why if you'd just doing the shooting learning a new because drug that and not worry about this complexity whether it's a great way right you just take a reflected here it be that the west as the bidding for you
cynical about secreted network on yet uses provide the dinner at corner is a very good being with her son rob reiner goddamn it was just to do just about your ago just before the pandemic at the core may be right after the pandemic so again that's all the data but the box okay what the new bike music don't need not be relevant and it's not all of it today a break at wonders of daring it's their way this point to deploy containers and they put on their knowledge of what would right and wrong with other
one expert who kept runner men during atrocities are blasted the stock is the hollywood bowl this way stupid way considered it does a lot for you to so would sell the war would shore bowed war battle tested in court as a couple more clicks rape but in the game gretzky mcbain still barry symbol it that could be cut to the guy she drew up would you would use his old lady what it'll take on earth we want jobs will know you what was she wearing or you want to do they know where that
so so what did crashed near the beach is to go on say okay got my stuff so coming into this discussion i thought it's really boils down to do it he guessed remedies or p. c. s then we also know women find it so that the whole other good cop together says the courts are rulers et un would put that you can see in the park has been an air quotes your list there's no sir bristow be on the scenes but they sleep you know how to manage the servers with land of the disabled
his leg hold any good either be cold that you will or get that could be talking to peter pan lendl say okay i'm way just sure purge you for actual usage but give us by people hits your land of that is the trigger couples fight users so it's about the book cos seabees but when death is a berry complex kopit and landed in service is a complex politics so i would recommend that for a beginner more for carsey being son than anything
most the elena's stress that even the bomb people would be doing this for long con i've seen so would that include patients all of them does seem so many betty boop imitations of the sea yes considine fuentes of cupboard eddie's great wizard well well that's a thought rape it so complex n. n. n. deposit back on me i'm sure if you look at label bid to shirk remedies for major goal absurd and that is in the beatings we're doing there one take a crack three of them on
you must know the one way i've thought about to run eddie's versus host sister says measures isn't a while it would have us leisure giusti i've seen them as almost two different approaches at war south korea is very gentle approach almost awaits her forties general cross flour in interceptors cope with oscar nannies as a way to go doctor files in a matter where you're running a need to be on premise to begin your company's deducted center you're on the same man
we're just created us an answer or on premise and this can be using open surf tooling instead of the clown providers service for that equivalent so if you're used to read asia we using a post grass darker country are as opposed to if you use a job us to be using r. d. x. there hosted did a disservice so with kerman eddie's you have a mirror your fingertips all of the world open-source tooling you know how this thing
works you're not walked him in cloud lambs using a stutter form on the be u. s. you're using their services are d. s is their implementation of relational data bases it's not open-source you don't know how their postscript stuff happens you to burn any signal have its own secrets manager ws has it's own secrets manager there are pros and cons in case of a u. s. you by using their services you get all the patches that updates everything's black box so it's more
manage and secured by using trinity's you have more visibility more control everything's open-source any dinner plate anywhere is our right so far so the cut johnston very good at selling points of cupboard is rape it's supposed to be generic so that the system and claudette to cope take a duty to yell if the people cannot says if early to control could see to deal but with thy command and the animal file you could deploy your ad with their kids
hold on a dub you episode piece that you know she seek your rouge or the sestak promise him in reality what gets you is that teacher new model right to deploy could be daddy's in aid of us the production level environment you would have to tie into that i am also a dub us lhasa you'll still be using these services even with currents the target corporate macleod right you just can't help it would expect that is the jury model
you know it's pervasive among all the services and again to lead singer to communities clustered at your back and he did you know you'd cut it deployed on to that cheesy peak when it usage and i almost guarantee you in a series called bad you have to access resources you're gonna have to get back to tomorrow and even if you don't write so let's use a principal railroad out it's going to write beginning of the west wing or pottery right good
spree file or as he bought it if he did what is on you know t. c. p. you counted on to deprive it to the g. c. get good wind of the astrid market sold yes committed these promises made the generic in common but in practice in god and then i can at least to this other hot cop they caught take off the box or to cloud rape you hear this lot were all our application or our products you can deploy on a debbie
less or t. c. p. henri shore it's easy it's not easy to do that the sales pitch what it does is easy to say something that's the idea of deployment readies cluster on different karpov ayers cold how about her form with the way it or shirts differ club providers break so they could be good but cheer for miss that is to see configuration language rate so did a good thing is this gil said that you learn to cold
therefore my maid of the west is transferable to t. c. p. one a policewoman show is a platoon career god i enter compare cloud on its they'll be willing to buy it compares okay he did is needed the west is we do duty c. p. great equivalent services so turf war is not trying to accomplish universality and she stratacom push your slow excessive going right to sponsor sits right and it's a common why would try so you know how did you tear for many debbie well
but say it could example all here to care for the grand espy bucket in a tub us neither did create the equivalent in p. c. p. each say okay why would she c. p. here's the equivalent to audit storage since doctor from cold just to dc keefe labor moray is so speaking of mostly cloudy tell us about azure cctv yep if you're number one eight of us not adverse event of the companies are gonna use that if you know put under
for jobs right you call that it be that u. s. issue or is the second most popular one in the business world because my curse off the somewhat upbeat eight of us it was beach kugel so if a ladle dusty street to negotiate well you almost a decade of your body short for free radio disc can it do that for just didn't want us to account for the other one is set a good joke is it by chris offutt order company donated us do it do donated us you'd be off the shore their target for should go
they're stolen i have some friends who are about accord and butter sauce and that there would be project g. a. c. p. it's great for the latter local t. c. could probably has the best you why both but to read the bad thing but she's seeking go with general is a political products and inactivity pepper to compatibility in she seek the database us look been over backwards to to accommodate being spewed don we'll head fifty years ago right this week
you have the c. s. classic you still have you know the way you can predict history but it's eighteen years ago or whenever it the best we came up because to do today for the most part google hates backwards compatibility that's why it's it's the least favorite of mine that three babies to the scene and earnest in services go beyond that risk category entirely defunct yeah there there's actually a great list all the g. c. p. thing cinema define the winked and posted but this agreed listen meal
hate is that the scuba breaks great to be the city's public to chill for you why perspective it's it's accidents but the best you why i'd use the aid of us is very cocky you why why is that the real conversation for our listeners as you'd be around them she manager says offered by the two providers and what i think we should talk recovered eddie's machine on unser says i personally usage maker on a dub us but the part about moss few episodes but just brush up it's a suite of machine and tools mom when she won
to aunt ada be ross it offers stringing them all including her role as asian distributed to training in monitoring the model training process when you're don deploying into it and couric than point to the arrest and warn one and you call as a bad batch and boring so if you just made you won off influences on ward rounds of data so they do not charge further juanita west and cord or recent weeks or west model calls in just
fully amazing and then all wunsch cogema motoring schools on top of your mom also is new again it comes in from new users does that new data distribution over lying drift away from the type of do you trained on animal you know you if so which is really powerful and is there applies not only does all the stuff for you and spine completely unfamiliar with g. c. p. or azure is machinery offerings in that domain our youth
familiar with them and i will know that that thing that's where the clever to come to that played in aunt ada be west to be describe it is new to me i see the intended this you know too old to two points of this contest is one you can't know everything's raise him such a complex deal and especially you know the trial where both the loss in which she learning that the big apple do bite already yelled wanna pick one or the other the other thing is collaboration where
oh well look cease bigger can do all these things and you know if you go to de los ti me you explain that rate is caught in a beam youth or nine like when a person of the muscle into party collaboration of all hey you saw this debate in the city's major tunney shorty you would get him down and then the dullest he didn't take a look at this and say okay will we be to secure it is you know we need to let do this with getting married saw patch is inside that she and her doctor file and saw this he didn't catch what would
the collaboration and learning the spirit for both sides but yeah from the ceiling this prospective i'm very ignorant of all the duma to get better but listen to your potash they had to apartheid stand and we're in the body go through any my label asked to obsess on stage maker of the prior that is assume she ninety six is not our cloud anything until the very end their why do women shouldn't when eddie's on a dusty drugs all talk about that competitive open source machine
the pipeline cooling because it does mention sage maker has a full sweep of pipeline tulane but it's all hosea carbide of us for you couldn't eddie's hasn't song's called tube for a candidate to orchestrate a pipeline close machinery trolling for you that includes the deed engineering the date injection engineering transformation and then various forks more like analytics system but the soap if you enjoy say drapery wanted to open source for ron anywhere near my
look into companies cube flow there's a concert sutherland apache airflow and some others although one thing they do with image should get up comes up a lot is cos and that's you know if you're a pig which you a production bethel you're cia o. or edgar see deal would you see out of those who say hey what's this expense but it's really do your its we deployed to your purse look how and i've got hit with this all law that bolted to the status quo i deploy into my purse look out the dawns
what the dared to deserve to get to tear down that scene you know you get a bill for ill t. box hundred bucks and i can be a surprise news of the one day guide thusly recommend is a jerk on a play with this all your purse look out there to be caught her by there has a bill monitor kisses all you've stood would put a box that you know you know you spend more than eighty bucks calls it a credit card rates would e-mail uniform you to that fled before you do anything turned out on arose
no you may get a surprise had been aren't so we talked a lot about what schooling thus far though look a lot of the history of god's hands we alluded to this than ups might not wanna be a wall did you take on as a machine engineer that would be to be a little to swallow stuck your guns machine and space or in the sage maker cooling thrown for a sofa my listeners machine running engineers with say
they've created the b. s. account it's been a bus age nigger projects in open sage makers studio to burn all booked the sub typing away treating aids care on small they were on the big they really learn say snickered not symbol spending maybe they'd even to korea signature model now as for rest and we use him all the way now that machine running in sheer maybe by a one-man band but if so what that's the small arms while it may be
what a spate what a fraud and you are air react friends or ministry butterworth far from distribution in a row fifty three new rocks and that friends in half to communicate with some back and was sale at ford apes python facts c. p. i's are then kicks off the machine learning ahmad all inference and courts so everything i just said is i would consider horny doable law
i buy my listeners maybe they would work assuring that entire staff there just mentioned using care reform so where does that word is that wall starts effectively why would be a good sweet of nene to schools in aid of us presumably using term for that my listeners would get started with actually deploy a product and it where is that wall begin where now you actually wanna really consider having and damn
and professional helping out with the rest of this process you had a great crushed and so i don't wonder dissuade anyone from what a turf war or doctor can score could read eddie's i just want to highlighted some beast was we have the steeper learning curve than others that and ashley that's how i learned to ride so i started three as at job with us and i thought oh well that's a blitzkrieg cold would play with that truffle was cool loaded with that and
a deadly it became my career so we'll i wanted to sweep it was from learning it that for me to be marked he should point is security powell valuable is to deny or halsey churches were data is your dear god hath be due to the wild is it okay bill was just no public didn't no big deal or is it no says if the idea medical data consumer dana identifiable didn't it occur answer is if my this
it got me into that kind to me yeah my company then that's when you wanna hire professional to take a look and make sure that the proper security precautions are met yet i'll just i don't talk about like you know if you're in a player around with the development instance with some think they know that's creepy should do that but if you're gonna release it to some friends are friendly people you should do that which are not trying to scare you but the lichter would say you have anything identifiable there yeah
truly want somebody dies on uppermost curie perspective those alot of very easy mistakes that you could make a new c. news and the news word for corporations couple weeks you'll wanna be one of them you know people that are really really good at this stuff things look through the cracks minutes to spur needed for the best people how about percussion said was look at this period things the other thing but just to consider is like if you're just using barry see two instances you wanna make sure those things are locked down and people could just go in use them
so good-bye curb the line item it's kind of the little bit paranoid but but the real sick if you really dirty user your open up forty you shouldn't people can hijack appreciated run up your below the intensely sweden watch out that the stuff to go to war exception should scare you just things that you were at all on the step up schools with the infrastructure is cold and configuration management technique in a trip to la repository it's about more berkowitz all the people working with other teams
you don't want personal shop show then you're weber is a job you know i did documented it's limited so experiment cried learned you know why we go what to say you know you can't do this right you teddy bears does you were the complexity of fraud but let me you may learned and end up wildfire on what this war the java devoted so did come in and she's my career been recruited journey are right so so secure in the city mark year
relate to pull the complex b. c.'s you're in over your head and you'll know we see it restores tinkering in or your projects distortion on doing security and he i was that was asked and for her so personally i'd general elena don't fire she would furnish the young voters of the good guys you don't security in a professional did these guys man manager watson the air ducts and see if you're just tinkering around this one has a funny billion machinery magowan sage maker be deployed
so as ear rest and point man can you guide us through an architecture to talk us through it and what services then argue shaming engineer or would want to use on a nebulous to expose this model to you know so years that sage baker i mean if you asked me to come up with the cub you're not in camp was a blood sunburn and save three years that excited on the street from dubai cloud front porch you or are concerned you mentioned media to bite on service
without beauty daugherty jeter running on the c. s. hook him up to her wish molded baser resonant presume you need to have some kind of states were there you always use pose grassroot oppose press and then it her former credible curiously sniffed your what would she do you know about that those are all good recommendations my advice is to sleep if it's not teacher says the data experiment that's how we all learn rape trial i'll see what happens then
when the good things about eight of the west is that there's a lot of documentation succumbs to much but the point cried out and see but the goodbyes maggie the senate is desolate spot on and what i'm ordering you to add that we totally forgot is that you should really put a automated build a duplicate what what's too so use exhaust like code by blind or your circle c either something like that choose your flavored that is something that will pay off in spades it's now hundred percent necessary boy you'll fly
and that it can hardly what about the decode friends first control push an automatic we ought to hear structure that for them are called an episode is c. i'd c. d. yeah and as he did use in addition continues when the ski run the process for according to commit u. n. c. would generally they mean is this really a measure of where we're so good but in general lee he will ever watch war periodic we build orchard you continually trigger from your source for palm jury will assemble your code
run tests run security since whenever you need gone to assemble your code package up into what's usually generically referred to as an artifact which is package of files basically that's the you know usually be continuous integration peace banana continues deployment peace is taking a package and pushing it out to your number sure turkey and turning it on and releasing it to users so it's really important to do that to make truth about processes repeatable
then you're not it's not prone to human error and also just say gee time i've seen a lot of projects in the past that that skimp on that step in the beginning then you just end up paying for it she go along so it's usually come away by number one piece of advice is don't skimp on you see as c. b. you would you start out that it is a bigger investment is not something you wanna wear along with everything else but it is something is she sick about deploying a piece of co now to the wild if you run into him upon to mrs gonna be trouble
you'll think of specially something that you want one boston the end it's called the sub index for myself as perspective that you wanted you to write this is how ashley i'd learnt automation use a job a code they worst locally now i want to deploy to to death so that you did you way folks another dozen could look at it in all the good man really wants a great i do namely twice a day after ten times i'd love cannot be the by the order so what it is on a busily
he does you know ticketed and then a machine behind scenes does it for me and i did you go get some coffee awesome space guys are right well shit io contrast another of depths pockets network we can show notes likes to do picks up the end of their episodes or my wake that's an effect now wasn't it because it's ability to be anything anything that you are currently into the new t. v. lately doesn't have to be technology really delighted the papers
when technology root out so i go first to do our part my big use of the show succession are not hbo max moore hbo i am blade to begin on this and biblical your life to be but that show is the impasse that journey strong medina claes campbell roy on a show the use of music so now i will pass she knew tyler are right my will be apropos this episode actually create her form skirt that spins up

as a python you could use it from but the real developer language could also they do what it could kill bob's you can know python is a very good system language to the white i recommend a pecan become soloist teaching him you know talking about learning right as it will actually if you wanna job that is to deter for many of us i could teach you a mouse that you can pass a control global interview and you know whole flooded and fake it to you make it by the o. okay but it was lorna stuff big cloud grew
you know we're so they have i lessons on flower so azure juicy dna of us their lessons or coolly formal end dialed in because they're intended for you to pass specific certification to pass this floors to know nobody writes about elena learning attract were there or there like these really dial professional view horses assault was linked to their learning tramp flow charge one of
which takes you down the path of designs which you marked specifically by way of the be honest on the sill unsavory person but hold the whole half is like really professionally don knapp and it's how i boarded speeds entirely however to ws the second o'clock group is my son is going to a similar path all of learning initially i was twenty jim but god didn't turn out that the greatest so that he would do you do you would to officially give us the deals or riley who are

q. flow k. u. b. s. alpo believe is an extension on coburn eddie's for machine learning a pipeline orchestration in last few episodes we talked about sage maker for compulsion is same thing and then in the damn ops episode we talked about just general dev obst pointed out your web stock to the cloud and if you recall there are solutions for hosting web stacks macleod like to be of us the c. s. and then there's the open sore
to quiver went to that's called cooper nannies and am u. s. service called ek astro lasted to earn any service all was used to raise on any of us even either you ccs or he chaos the cspi be using it in a u. s. is a managed service for hosting a darker containers and sustained easier to use and he k. s. allies occurred many sir is isn't like you to kosher to run eddie's cluster on eight of us the benefit for many years is that is open source and cross platform you can hold
your committees questrom debut as g. c. p. board azure setting up in those various providers and be a bit different so as not just a turnkey one size fits all but as can be more cross cloud provider compatible then if you had set up your kloster on the c. s. so any of us p. c. s their manage container hosting solution is easier but there's bender walked in and then a ek asked their managed to cooper nannies solution is harder it's more calm
lex for certain as you recall good discussion with juror was but it is open sores and it is general case cross cloud compatible and you can use on local poster on crime and so the equivalent in the machine learning space is amazon sage maker for their hosted machine where in offerings verses cuba flow an extension on top of cupboard eddie's for the open-source cross cloud compatible version of the same and before we get into this interview i just wanna talk about
these things up or these high point orchestration colds because sage maker is not just about hosting machine and model as the tip of the iceberg it's a very useful solution the war ended your machine on a model macleod is it easier to use sage makers model and points or batch inference jobs than it is to try to spin up your own machine learning model who sued solution even on a piece yes or the sea to or anything like that so
even just a ploy your machine learning model by a sage maker is gonna be a simpler solution then roll your own but the main dicey vickers not just close your model is all the other stuff that comes as part of a package what we call pipeline orchestration so we're training your model you have your data comes from some more like a of u. s. s. three you were there relational data base your sword yes or or dynamo de bier something k. and then that it's piped into a feature transformations that and then that despite
to training stabbed the training phase of this pipeline that training phase might be splitting out your data were spilling out your compute instances into multiple instances of it the training can happen in parallel and then we'd join the progress down stream as the next step in the pipeline do some checks some bias checks some drifts detection and an employer models of the cloud and an additional is part of these pipeline orchestration schools there is a cunt she knew
listen monitoring aspect where if something goes wrong in a good model pipeline that might trigger a week training job by u. reusing the entire pipeline from the beginning or let's say that new data comes in over time the users of interacted with your website for awhile let's say you have a matchmaking service for music or videos and a thumbs up thumbs on certain things and so you want to retrain not because anything went wrong with because your little bit out out of date so these mushy
morning pipeline orchestration tools like sage maker or cube flow are the angle of creating a production ready deployed machine learning and stay and solution not just the machinery model macleod but the entire process or goes eventually into the trained and deployed in from small macleod is so all those steps of the pipeline are important in so everything we've talked about was sage maker save maker has these schools for stringing together steps of the spy
one is pipeline orchestration one will be ingesting the day that and will be to engineering so feature engineering an imputation all at another will be training including parallel is a sham and so on and so let's say shoemaker which is a dub us is hosted offering it's easy to use but you're locked into each of us so today we're talking about cuba flow which is that an extension on top of coburn eddie's it's the open-source version of sage baker
effectively it is universal sukhumi hosted on all the different cloud providers and again for the discussion the juror was the downside is gonna be more complex to manage so that's an introduction to the topic unless i've read them are i'd welcome back to show everybody today we have heard from dad proper enter coverage is she so yes thank you tyler hide my name is the gown and a one part of the dutch dennis feinstein the debts i held my clients of billings
or solutions to discover valuable insights under dana and an end to salsa critical this is shown to us both ways she learning as well as more like low-level day analysis and i were gulag also on the machine running engineering ford and it's also are gonna talk about today necessity in the past few episodes we've been talking a lot of doubt lots with the with the goal both of which you mean camelot the machine model into the clown named in his journey of ammo on
so it relies is not just a matter of getting your your model in the cloud as some rest and point which sage maker can accomplish very easily but what time's up pipe when you want to build out so you by your training phase of old periodically in just the day that i may be short that out to multiple nodes and that's what's the date up crushes it is certain way brings it back together and says you know she money mom and so there's all these different headlining tools on familiar with sage make represented on the show alas
ups and we talked a little bit bowed down box i'll look about cooper nannies in doubt lots and soup today your specialty reined in and all odds is she and flow that yet but so we read them and a complete touches upon the cuban eddie's as well as it's basically they obey orders traitor for pipelines on kennedy's soap operas popeye born son general under haven't choose the topic smile was yours but don't know that dawns officially down the motivate
and though the entire process and eventually will get into what were the options out there and white cube slow the caucus about pipelines get the food so the first thing and it's it's good to know is often when you have like peas these examples these coy examples of mercy learning problems or any day the problem it's very much focus on on the solution itself and training the model to predict something and then use that are put to optimize this is perot says he's sore or decision-making however what we see are
clients mainly is the belief lot of our clients of different this is powerful which we develop different morals would you get the point where you have so many models in place then it's knowing how well i'm on was still performing n. n. retraining the model is gonna think a lot of time and you basically ken's just spent time on that retraining and checking if someone was still proper be working if they're all son you use cases that that that juror working on for a client so
and a pointer kind of force to to move away from stand alone wattles and popcorn machine and pipeline train because that really felt shoot to first of all keep track of the performers of the model that helped you to automatically a retrain models legislature life much more leisure as it's taken a lot of time wayne and keeping the quality of the models of it almost sounds like one continues integration can she is the poignancy icy need is for the software world and i knew she
on a model when she learned pipelines is for the machine running deployment world is so as having good analogy the supper for the most nothing that i think that if he if you look at what is science field and in general it's much more moving towards a continuous integration and a continuous deployment of models of course by the big companies like golan face when they already do this for a long time it's also widely known as these free morton these platforms that basically
allowing u. as it is scientists are machine an engineer to do that as well and they have invested already a lot of money in those solutions but i think like more like the smaller companies they especially in the beginning it was more focused around killing a model ordinance all the numbers the solution and sometimes it can elect the continuous development in and deployment an integration off like the machine and solutions gonna think a lot of companies now start to realize that meeting and pipelines origin
as important as spilling a model because more without a without a proper popeye by the hundreds is eventually not gonna perform as well as when it was just the fellow because david james overtime especially amount for example with covert so one of these models that predict customer behavior or did take the simmered behavior into account to predict something else so special is colored and returning cord is more important than ever big
as customer behavior really changed during the periods when he can imagine when you use a model that was trained on variable four day period then describe the reform as well as there was a during michael the dorothy code because behavior totally changed so it keeps up so these pipelines keep up with the times of the change in didn't do you find yourself i know that these three works and what were you call is from irksome as a right to call them pipeline framework swore i think one of the proper term would
the pipeline orchestrate ers you find yourself using these exclusively or do you still do your mom all the velma on local hosts justin talk about spencer flow wherever they can in a band so especially with clients that reward we've already longer we now move to words developing from my pipe one perspective and of course the development of the motto in the testing of the manon first version of that evaluation of the model that can still happen outside of the pipeline
what everything around it and the structure is basically said out to be financially be used for pipeline kind of architecture and then we also have these kinds where we'd sure started peeling solutions and they're sometimes we see that there's first the needs to be as c. how old machine learning our designs the solutions can help improve their business so you could say they're less mature and and we often see the pipelines are not really good way to go yet big
three first need to really does go for what they use thousand machine learning can bring for his client but for long term relationships and cleanser really merger know we really move towards developing for my part my perspective rather than a stand alone mortal like that it's not measure twice cut once the new town are unique in the minds and popcorn developing course the pipeline once and for production or three steps ahead again sorry for all the diversion you are
spurred she sits in this area so even on the discussion when you drive and take us on a journey talk to us about que flown in the various other options in alaska yeah and so the reason i made it to confer with that because that's one of the main orchestrated or one of the pipeline focused project that the pleaded then chose to go with and to maybe start off with like would really cute flow is already mentioned it before your phone is basically a solution that folks is to
poise the machine or empire buying on a cuban any specter and and that helps to make the pipe livery stable when it's one of course dickie benefits of cuban eddy says capability that you have and also the same time que flow into graceful lot of these different kind of framework sways in so it allows you to reduce sensor flow or psychic learning or pie torch and all of those modules or packages are you like to call on you can for
the easily incorporate those in q flow salute and que flow itself doesn't necessarily have to be in the pipeline consoles offer to possibility to basically submitted job on any cuban eddie's kloster so just like a training job ward eight data processing job but it also the same ben's unless you're using de que pro pipelines architecture to builds of four on pipelines and that really use to flow as a whole lot of flexibility in them
size also it being open source so a lot of people the fellow cotton and corn tribute to the framework itself and in which you'd see because it's open source for want of these challenges that we use the company do you with us will honor companies do with those low scores and because of that the open-source nature of q. flow you see that the fellow who goes really fast and every day there's like something you released wage might also saw a form of your problems which otherwise she would've had to spend quite soon
i want to slow it yourself in the last episode with juror watts workers comparing cube flow with in a u. s. is you see a service last containers worse and so we have a big cloud native offerings microsoft azure to plow platform hearings as on when serves as an episode we recommended it and us if nothing else but popularity segment which is like you or find a job on when most like the buyer john invaded us marketplace because of it's not a popular and say shoemaker lamb
and the way they pipelines is what is this a lot of overlap with q. flows off and attorneys are so sage maker would probably be equal of cute flow in cloud native on a u. s. and p. c. s is equal and of cougar nannies on aided us on a bed could hear perpetrator platform but talk was source we don't have is going to haneda stuff works by by that standard you would see it coburn eddies and cube flowed be preferable why market open-source a feud
and in the same thing in first place on arab us and juror wants the man was good for nannies is quite complex award told to swallow from about but the thing compared to use yes they are and i wonder if that similar to your own experience and if so how does cube flow comparative nana non je to cloud noon machine and offerings as so maybe did the first good thing to know is even though cured flow in summer
it's really built on cuban mideast it's not just limited so wiping goo cloud because the full sullivan of the history of carl pupil region and scum from google and how date internally deployed she learned by applying for all their services and they built like his entire tens if opec it around a difficulty effects which we will touch upon layer is long but q. flow is not just limited to cuban eddies and also in the same thank you for pixel lot of this complex deployment froze
is that you have with cuban eddie's takes it away and doesn't for you so especially as the machine learning engineer or dana scientists you might not be very knowledgeable about curing eddie's or no audience an ounce of how to deploy something cubans would cure for the facilities that for you and help you with that and the same time que flow can be deployed on coming most big lead from flight data we were as airflow is your cool clouds and in
cool clergy even as the option to deploy don't cuban eddie switch it originated from or more like a ai a pledge form would they now call ago for dick cia platform so i think whereas when you focus for example on more like a bill us or just an azure you're very limited to that platform we've que perot you can reach across just want platform in hefty possibility an opportunity to know just the two won by firm but also the employee in honour platforms
if you need it of course is surprises can relive the different but a lot of the complex of the cars with it is handled by careful and i think that makes secured arguments for using cure for together with the open-source nature that has the added another great erred in with it being cross was formed to paddle is low blows the bellman with sage maker one thing i'd pop against in developing with the clout in mind the benefit is that again not measure up what
once you're in the mindset working where the p. c.'s and scary groups and i am policy use before you can even more on your moral pronounce i'm good luck with the body in local de beaumont the key to be a v. p. c. narrow your spin us up on your local p. c. your behalf to create an action host macleod or declined the piano say look max the bbc ourselves so the complexity that you're on my disgust of cooper no use in use case in general in
that's one thing brawl were not accounting for many times the complexity of developing towards the sea yes when you're gone and fireman's local house since scenes like this one is pros and cons on both fronts for what smooth talk about the debate of complexity and and you guys use crew were nannies for the general about stuff for web web hosting swirl by thing did kind of depends reply and i'm not really aware of that poured design warwick for the day the science thinks i'm not worthy of the ia weapon
not at the filament team i know would dare orson appointments that have been on and cuban eddie's what for them that i'm really not sure how will that the fog shorty and fomenting said that tackle the court your preferred choirs g. c. p. is that correct i wouldn't say preferred it's more like a lot of work lions work with that i'd faint in europe in general for long time ago was together with a scheerer has been one of the lead to bigger blow up of forms a ws is kind of
taking over i think at the moment but i think it's also because we're in timor cutting business or a lot of hard finds that the solutions to weep built for them or more cutting related and a lot of those lines were grief google products like away at school analytics of those in a cool based products and it's also the reason why they often go for approval cloud because it's logical decision to make if bowater fewer our systems are also by goebel develop ago that makes sense to have azure we do it
dealer fresher but we do see is under constant use azure or often less more cutting focused issue might say it's more like operational base of operations financially focus solutions that we can build for a yes so for example we have a kind of did indeed the real estate developments business and rebuild them warwick operational solution for them and they're also an issue that adds a lot sooner the puzzle mine and people who are trying to use
or macleod miss the witch winch but the guy was aided us just because it's most popular so it's easy answer but i never have any real technical argument for any of the specific cloud providers right yeah i think if you're in a marketing this isn't your real using our big herbal products it's one of the most logical steps to make from any connectivity standpoint of course she can get to the dado from cool analytic for google and slowed to any of the outer platforms but some of the integration sorry no
it's more straightforward with cool club than ways for example analytic school one of the nixon data we were as an art as yours foreign live on a suitor microsoft up the schumann mud and potentially c. n. n. g. finance as an example or operations people and finances so used to excel that's my piss off products seems like one easy step towards that platform if you're coming from an environment in which microsoft products would have made sense on the desktop daredevil am also for example are
a lot of the company's center for jumping using microscope dynamics are those kind of packages are those kind of self worth their walls would make sense to stay with the weicker soft related close i know for some companies that aren't allowed to use go go and solo mainly a big thing again nothing switzerland lot of the company's there do you wanna stay away from google sewed very wrong like your phone calls them or still on prayer or also measure and it also
the reason is g. c. p. have its own version of sage made birdsong non que flow based m. l. pops off when possibly including pipeline orchestration yes so this is a thinker couple of months now with gold clown shoes to have the wood because like a diet that for bids were all your de ayer related stuff live in so your jupiter notebooks your jaw blogs your model and coins all beckham the stuff and
dave recently changed that to something they call for dick sailing and with that day did some more possibility whereas a guy but for before yes what the pipeline option for the pipeline option was mainly consisting of acute flow kind of pipeline was there is some cuban any specific would you had to do is spin of the cuban is closer the board coupon bad and then you crude bill during wattles live for example with your facts and then when you
would go to the pipeline section in iowa but for i would exceed open up a need to you why you team to face a foot of kubo now with for dick cia they have full it a bit of a different approach is still can run que flow lad what you can also orchestrate your pipelines but still from within your phone when all the cure would know the stove is handled four years we don't have to spin obligated to reduce costs are aboard those famous thanks so it makes the little bit more piece you're done deal
when is more managed yeah it are we bringing are the migrating their regional offerings to this noon vertex the isolation is re branding risen and all toward a solution of thing that sullivan above so some of the stuff for my eye but for right now they're read grinning at the end and including would only within the new verdict cia section nine hundred of her dixieland brands but for example the option for pipelines is still be traceable in both they and but for as well
all as the four decks account for it and also interfaces are different if you go to da hybrid form by planning to face you kids basically to cuba and her friends however when you go to be the interface of pipelines inverted cia you're really getting dedicated cool clouds pipeline interface attribute of fellow by google and not necessarily by que flow to potentially vertex ai is this age maker cleveland's one juicy even managed machine in oxford yeah raises all by google for ghoul
our visitor have first-class orange juice you keep tube flow is the most by goes wrong yet is the fellow by the denser floating okay or not mrs an intense afflicting him but it did spilled around tens of love and to seville pipelines to facilitate those fanciful apartments okay dolores tucker full pipelines what is he a fax to sweat and gadsden slower senate ethics emanated thus far senate basically started to win in google and dead wrongs or courage
only a bond on on cue from us think hugo's still the only option to which you can deploy this flux and pipelines and it was a kind of away from google to basically make pipelines for all their big services so all the models that are behind their gould e-mail or gold calendar or google maps like all these big services in which they have water for seeing moaning models running they all needed to pay a continuous that
one of course this is a future visits and also it needed to be scary aboard because you can imagine those services argues body by millions of people incentives for how would they developed world as an internal service the bills what is now known as que flow and tens of low itself for a long time blisters model bill into law a deepening models fishing and almost problem listed models but with the extended baggage it reaches for didn't just a more boarded the city
except entire port before billing and training amano so like cleaning up your deductions forming your day and checking for anomalies creating a schemer from new delhi and buddies and reading your dinner from for example bakery or katy the club are getting cool go on and also the port after de machine on moral so the devaluation of the modern checking if the retrained for show him on oldies is performing as well as the previous version curtis
we're jumping can imagine and if you dude continuous training for a model using those pipelines that you cannot end up in a situation where you return your model but for most of it is not necessarily better than the previous version so also that is something enough to take into account and finally of course pushing your model to you you're an end point to a location inga will cause storage for creating a claim on all of it all those steps they basically bills more jails
in the tens of flow package along that to facilitate of steps and all the steps together create a wood equality effects pipeline which has been deployed for youtube flo why is that the song like a lot of overlap between t. f. accent you full court the differences between the two so basically opens the flow expanded is just the logic poured so how or you the building up your model how are you generating your skin mahal your transforming your model holly you be fill you in your model
and for dead they all made ladies components which they call it components serious like the trainer components you have a refill you waited components and a sadistic generally component all these components an open forum like the pipeline and they ordered lloyd on cue burnett is for example group could cure for so basically the back end of the pipeline askew flow and that executes the tens flowed senate code i see is so very easy
q. flow especially on she's seeking you're also gonna be using to support stand there like to have a few are working with a sense of lamotte over definitely butcher not limited to you good as well use high court you could use psychic loan or are in any of the other major machine known in frame or some rather but originally it is to filibuster rounds tend to float feathered because it was like an internal servers and google is area mao
of tons of flow extended you can use if you're developing a model and by torch to select a lot of nice utilities in there yeah so so then you get into the compatibility issues between high towards than ten slow like theoretically you definitely use those blood the way hard forges beloved and intensify was build up the road leader is saying but technically there are sometimes quite different i'm not sure future dried blood to try using both applied for
jan tons of cocaine you're saying she running goat is gonna be a lot of debugging and in the law the cases you're gonna end up using a new one on the other young actually and that high caste come a point project is this juror was in any guide you have to use bulldoze framework sensor cases justice on certain packages are making use of unit is by using doleful then the same i actually kicked off that term jobs other running on two separate python numbers based managers need to get out in a part
schiphol battle with each other yet they're fully n. n. also just like the types of power would be outputs in imports are are are the findings in both beckett is a very similar bird is sometimes when goes little details the rooster compatibility i know there are like arson cases where people do manage to come blinded to button so painstakingly presence of blood or rat we have you wanna get your machine amal host you have azure juicy diego us an awful lot to others
those men treat each of those three all while you to do yourself using open-source cooling though would the u. for nannies and cube flow and they also allow you to do it through their offerings which makes it a little bit easier when you're locked into their offering so those are called managed solutions dwi says is sage record she c. p.'s is vertex arid lands it sounds like a whole bunch of other
losers offerings is well we've got airflow an owl flow and well where else are you familiar with and to those that you can speak to how they compared to reach out so what i'm familiar with this pretty limited to airflow bands to float and uncool clouds of pipelines i know that the wound also measure park west not like practically a book or theoretically what i like about the
cube flow sometimes like one of these discussions with colleagues bothered us and they work for example in an azure pipelines barefoot lot of these small issues with indication issues of compatibility issues information being shared between different components that's all handled by a the combination of t. effects and and and que flow so dad's early why a diaper for q. flow but it's also i might be quite bias because i use at a lot of things afloat and what i do and
solutions i built and i just find t. combination between tia flex and cube flowed to be very cute new beginning it's quite a painful process to plug very steep learning curve and you can get very frustrated and during the prices of trying to understand how are they were together an especially in the beginning because i remember when i started working with your most recent version rose zero point twenty five and renounce version one point four and just a time frame of six months'
the frame words have improved so much that a lot of those folks little dishes of all been taken away and you just see that there's a lot of dedicated time and efforts bent on improving the services them for what i've seen for example as yours that sometimes it can take quite a while both for some three basic issues or refer which you would expect that that they would be so much quicker done what is actually happened and reporting like air flow from what i've read than what i've seen so far away
is what is airflow record is so airflow is is basically the new order straighter dead that would fit one backs and then i have to wait for twenty official tournament is directed at the cyclical glance yeah what is so so in the pipeline emptied out each step countenance huge other stop yeah that is to develop and would the thing with airflow is is that it's not resource heavy buying wherein you deploy something on cuba eddie's deed for
assistant our inner resources that you can use impurities or by big fight could scare you boliden can take quite some heavy loads however a good thing is with their flowers that you basically for all the computational heavy stuff you have to submit for example a job through a habit for so when you wanna train your model on cube fell on cuban eddie's you can choose to submit a job to wear platform which you can as well just traded on the back end of cuba which is given and as you can just training all
acumen and so we carefully dawn of the option because it's basically just an orchestra nerd and executes the different steps in your pipeline but when you knew something that's more resource has a new always have to have something like andy i'm good for the spin of the machine that contented to have you were close to deep competitions in the model turning unknown suspect information by ceo can see better stand so tube float is bad headlining it and model order
trish an income when eddie's with machine in mind yeah in any higher floors of the general purpose jostled stamper i yeah and it just so happens again what machine in about one sherbet you just to be using some machine tool kit or claar offering what juicy piece that platform that you will never never be able unless you have a very light monastery the little thing that but when we're talking much heavy models machine learning the burning model for example that the key
and in millions of rows of data that you always have to have something else and just airflow because otherwise senator conrad to use air flow does it have a place if you're using grazing cute closer your reason you never use air flow for eating so what we do adept is we do a lot of data engineering tasks on their foot cell trade harangued the export of data from one location to another or the creation of tables all that stuff that happens within and
burn farming but still nice to be scheduled we need to know and mainly through airflow in for dead and works for you will want to swab for machine morning okay so if a call by moret in this you need a job us lands above managed step pipeline orchestrations is a thing called a conscience the husband step ingenue my hundred of slam those two men have a series of just roff auction that feed into each other and in a specific war or non branch out and come back together in a smooth general
are the sounds like maybe there flows for that purpose yeah i think you would you could system and then how an elf lord you have any new areas issue with that i have no i've heard about and low flow but i've never really worked with with their services to get it sees as anything in releasing some middle c. forgive somebody here in the future to discuss started to see emma flow coming up but often that that i have not really seen anyone within our timidly said uses a mile from okay but
it's none of megan rocket that not that i've seen yeah so the main contenders that i have seen really in my world is u. n. meet when did you have flown into his safe return as funny thing actually i'm gonna work besides maker for riches feet which is profiled in u. s. run and a delivery in oakdale all your love so that was as lose hanjin so there comes from babs the agency is the master or organization i actually working for can
recall rocky which he says suitors recently acquired his law allows smaller companies within the agency and so it's nice that rockets mean skill set as a dub us in clockers man that's mean skill set is a azure a dingy city for the record at the burger grads get together we basically convert the biggest acero full of blood firms and as you have anything else to say about to reduce fuel flow to answer for extended or any of the other offerings
that i think in general we talk about the benefits are false tupelo compared to what your options are rather the most important thing is not really what you're gonna use eventually his discovery your options and and see what is out there in and what fudge on purpose because in the end all these solutions of options they all serve for purposes battered another i can imagine that the few lord completely set up in the middle you as they would really make sense to go with something of
and so trigger even dole queue flow livers the street cool solutions and of course you can still the point you're going in and the witness of course the thing the main lesson is to just move to words a more like pipeline or just a thinking machine on a par binds rather than just then alone models and then which confirms searched the best that screwing up to your situation personnel file was found on your phone anti effects to work free world together and is has served
so for most of them the news of our plans are nazareth situations in which to flow is also not gonna commit free yeah i like the idea of starting to think towards orchestration instead of just legs and savages local close marlboro man in ensuring if you're in a trainer amal by a quickly just starting on one of these platforms your training job we'll be able to shorted out to multiple nodes unit and potentially macleod ideally in clough
so they are confined to your own local was cheap use limitations or if you don't have a jeep your no law go devolve on max and that you can do machine learned very well on max is that's you would say she's eighty just kicked off the cue flow by byron sage baker by buying and it will assure your day out if you have a huge days second world trade on multiple nodes manrique combine the results downstream our history our training does a lot faster doesn't have to be an expensive because the
news on eight of us you can use it old spot instances other super g. in our little less reliable was super super cheap and just he has it's own guevara was orozco machine charging like a different the fertile machines of the orders of the spinal denied a and s. b. spices are actually is this like access can keep capacity from song would lead one organization reserve some out of the new can reduce our happened i'm not using it at that time you can still when baghdad and you're paying substance
what's the record you by your machine might get taken offline if it were is issue comes back you basically house sitting for them i'm not sure if it's cool caucus and one good 'cause i haven't seen you before printable instances and it's the cruel blow equivalent for them but you can see disabling ghanaian deeper sense of what's all on my friends her doom shimon inhibit amount all say you'd you use eight of us should often training job on a jeep you based instance the use of spot instance
you say ninety percent this beat for an inspection and so that is since costs one dollar per hour to ron with a g. for two x. large cos like one or two one or forty around one nine eight percent say is it's young fourteen cents per us huge difference by the downside is picking come off line actually somewhere where you been on it's you say it i'm willing to pay two dollars is the price hikes and everybody else wants that house sitting job
i'm going to like payable over the ridge open arms but you'll find yourself in a regime we rarely and so the spies are radical useful invaluable and not as unstable as they would see that once you when you see suffer like production rickety wooden uses for long running instances was phenomenal for training jobs so you would recommend them also to use of already employed in and models that are running for by the desired unimagined and so how we ended the caterpillar stock is that everything is
the pendant on one another so the d. output of a model is gonna be taken up by a solar job to basically getting our goods to the location for one for one of them can be used but with the spot instances has called how would that affect for example when your worker is taken away because it's utilized by the regional organization is your job than just waiting until it's finished for the cigar for miller how was that i'm gonna play out we definitely would music in hope host
training this is only for the development venice or the training like was in your mom all drifts needed some learned that it needs a retraining job the new in response is it depends on the framework being able to pick up or less on focuses on essence goes down big idea buddy epson juicy kids call printable instances if that goes down it depends on cancer clubbing it'll take snapshots and then picked up from where the last snapshot left off in wooded then have to notify him
self to try again going unused on instance pick up or left off the force saying that the job is don to kick off the next occupied one that bunk and this time the idea that you could do this and settle because the bellman of your model training art you can get this off to cloud using sponsor says from cost savings and i'm steep yourself with an orchestra she heard on a thousand is a very good solution to the conflict training local your paid full price for
and for machine so again what would what iowa's what to do is to strain on a small subset of the adjusted the book and then when everything is working just submit the entire tiring day is said to the model was in the pipeline and so far mr morton pretty good but i guess this would also be quite a good solution to come down costs to surf on what's your abdomen and are you the sea legs and go so when i'm at home i use our windows
the seed ai values linux than men and warrick would also be peace you could back mac had known the next i've tried it like a bad university was but i know my focus is war two were slim on a building and theoretical designs about life on all the hassle that goes into setting up for the next in the proper way they didn't really enjoyed them much a devil am acre estate haven't sea otters john remember growing up bad in the early days of limits and the war between all distribution flavors neverland
jonathan boston is a bunch you on the seaside had on what the managed limits find anna was gents you on the other side and thus him and it turns my wife with the bodyguard gents into this there are makers opponent equally to funnel yes i know i'm under the old days engineer was like a teammate jesper it's you pretend that he wouldn't they would use linux at home i use legs quite often and all three a usenet windows undermine its windows for gaining two clinics for all the bomb at north increasing
and try to do on my own vomit in the cloud of first i would like to ask if you could take us through a project beginning to end journey the beginning being i know i wanted to older i'll as second class are there any pending i want up whoa someone how would we decide which car buyer use were for shoe that was first coolant at what is the training process look like within the tools that you would end up selecting what is the pipeline wide
like when women have we got in on one hundred and four website so from my gay uproar together client or more like a general personal project was say our listeners they went quiet klein says look i know i need a bra commander sister maureen image classified or even as an alternative the climate may also calm with their own specific and barman neither microsoft shot or are there are using who will further how it's so in various forks in the roads during this cross
us about why our machine an engineer might choose one solution over another and then as you go through those steps huge slip by as we're braun won i'm choosing kids love them incense never sure yes so i i think in and the first abandoned for leaving davison for where the first up would really be to go back to d. d. drawing table and an have alluded to data to really see if what they want super one day you request is also what they need when we often see is that
klein's come we're paying direct question and already some bizarre one id what they want however one week is what we always do first resort to it the perot says it's called david discovery so we see what systems are employees how's ortiz says things connected what they had to we have what do we see from the date and so like a small version of an eighty eight can we even supported that solution or questions that they have with the current david innocent lives so that law
really be step would even closed up zero go back to the drawing say we'll see if the question of declines happened to the client has this really would they also need because for good or very very nice example is due to stick to lug recommend assistance when we entered kind of came to us with the question my gal we wanna have recommended system on the web site when we started looking into their data and an investigating customer behavior and an end to roll the system's already had in place we actually discovered dead than you do better
heard function so did in the demurred leper commander on the website they needed the way for for people who visited a web site to find products for easily because what we already could see from wonder first discovery phase is that he was very ford for people to search for products because often approach one's really sure what that when the search for so that really would be steps syrup to scholastic surgery implement some assorted the client went with a tool which i've forgotten the name
for think it's something called like a seeker but i'm not sure is so yeah best of cell where maria where roads but okay let's say decline goes with the question and then that isabella question and it's a valid problem that we cancel all fun and awaited they see it after we have donned a bid to discovery we see that the riots is some sort of place or some system still need to be implemented for everything too were blokes where was first luper the bay is they're already a platform that they are working on
a lot of the closet come to us or are they your clients that already have a cup of four major a deli where school cloud or or measure what in case they don't have such a thing we look at what's their services award today or do you resent which club but for my needs to be integrated with those other service most days when so in case of likewise and can increase if it's there are companies that use a lot of cool products then theological recommendation would be
stuart using cool cloud one and the others are other side is a howard hughes and a lot of my curse off early reports as your would be a recommendation to that would then be stabbed one setting up their direct foreigner violence and then step two would be for today the engineers to make sure dead all the data is in place and everything is so valuable but also does the pangs of course all news guys because there's a limit of a day in separation approach because in some of the k.
is more sore doing this for c. ok decline wants to see if the output of the eastern n. n. no sir tomorrow is even gonna help them improving your decision making and is some cases they really want to have feared continuous employment n. n. use of our bid from wanted so in the first is to say okay we first on to develop an amman old fella dating now put in an emerging that to the carpet for unemployment on their board bit more happens that the clients like okay i want this
princely to live with him a couple of four and then we start developing this together with the dayton jurors who first major and all of the discipline is that all the data is fleeing the distance while some most important things in dislike entire process yes they have creme de otherwise not really gonna get anywhere with the article from will only cleaning today yet in your journey you or are we just looking at the data deceived its quinn is so in this case cleaning of the dermal full steps in cleaning the air
he's already like a deep freeze selection so if there's any false the degas did we already know all waiting to greet him or getting all the data together making sure that david is excluded from the data so does finally gonna be used by the day the scientist to build a solution is in my opinion by the right thing to do because when you're out already noted this faulty data than there is not really any reason to intrude on blessedly group very specific used is of course so there's already like a pre select
and the premises but then once all the data is in place and this is also for slated for diff process that goes back and forth in between good and the third step which is today those scientists explore new day and doing some beauty aids is he ok what do i know over d. c. as in statistics and fish realizations from what i've done it seemed to and then he goes back to date engineer because maybe for some of the day that a lot of fellows are missing or though make sense or not
i'm not going to ride forward to like stepped up to three top or camilla can picture differences so when the two three are finished that's when we start developing the model so transforming year to intruder for dried include what we also like to do is we take multiple wobble purchase so we have like a baseline model so let's say certification problem retained collector brennan for st ago gerber and fortification model which is very easy to emblem
and minority can give you the first results confirm that we see okay where is it performing well where is about performing well maybe we need his chains and stuff new data so we go back to step three into reagan but then also known from their restored to maybe do felt any more advanced model if for example the base one was no warning one half or so then will we get more to disparage of developing that the defense mortal the wheels of getting to the stage off making sure did you more can be
employed and if we wanna build a pipeline around and make sure that all the components that are gonna be employees around the more blood cells are being built up an indirect well with the porridge on today the engineering side so this kind of like a pig pelham parallel prose as we both the vote goes the more toward the advance wobble attended the same time rounded we'd build the pipe and then when we have evaluated the custom ana winds performing well an end
how could make sense we made sure did the entire pipeline is the point so that bundy did engineer kang also used the outputs or toward a model train by the pipeline to predict on new dado which there can be used for any activation purposes that were determined didn't like the discovery for this so this kind of like the due process that we walk through which all water replies but definitely not all the glands in tiny decided
that had been face between lasater on g. c. p. vertex ai versus q forum yes so currently the depend so that a lot on offering more deter using those currently you when you use consumer obstinate even like tens of floyd self is saying that it's for now better to still use didi cube flow like the cuban eddie's kloster implementation zodiac affirmed the implementation it shows the verdict day of the medicine is quite new skill and my mobius
evil is dna i've been formed into attention so for now we're whenever we deploy such bye-bye is still an epoch for bugs essentially it will the bans on and if there are any find specific requirements that might not be met by eatery i'd love for verdict cia or ai bedford park was totally disappear and that merge with inferred excessive force in all man so many solutions i guess you know in in wendell melman
this annoying one framework says well there's captain expressed fast if i fasted yang and all those things that are for the coarse sand as a mix of selecting a tool cents to become an expert in the moods and with a puzzled a difficult this sounds incredibly powerful winds popular tu que flow that islamic beverly keeps coming up is almost repeated boils down to the so i'd ulysses mc or oftentimes i reconsidered charges sir learned dudes
on the other girl lot of issues listings in yeah i think it's also kind of the nature of depth we work of lot of different clients so we don't really have the luxury of color that that we can stick with one platform you have come on our own yeah and no one of the known fastest ways to connect with other platforms with limited knowledge or not knowing all the dedicate the pipeline orchestration for reads the firm platforms is use
if you follow because they can connect to all those different conference and of course in some cases it might be better to use a dedicated solution of but for nothing especially when your in the business of that's where you have a lot of different lines lot of different but for some work with finding a solution dead expands across those platforms and his knowledge dependent on just one platform that really helps us to deliver fell you to all our clients and it makes us all so much for flexible
the dissolution so we can build center clients for which we can solve the problems that are really powerful deciding corridor where agency we have lots acquired securing the same boat it probably pays ago kerwin eddie's tube full because the general isolation and i really think so therefore should also trigger rudolph having different people with different expertise is of course but from what i've seen a lot of foreign if there is just a couple of people that do one thing you'll never get his ski
who does one everyone were shown by the same thing in and can basically improve themselves but also the team you made progress much faster than wonder choose one person focusing on one solution another person focusing on another solution then the knowledge sharing is also we learn some of the with your flow someone or so for climbed as a billy where's the news can flow want another colleague who were to the clown the goo clerical she's cute when men still in some way they can share their knowledge with one another way
she is gonna recorder between someone who's dedicated to say trigger and some were dedicated to ensure bye-bye infertile bathroom in the supervalu ohlmeyer really pre shape as their diaz you wanna say about your floated fog spend it or anything else no i think whoa we just what's above like sums it up pretty nicely cube flow is the inflexible solution of that serves most of the bradford's and not just the board freeze her blood froze but also to
she won from works but also in the end it comes down to woodward's as freer but i think for us is an agency the biggest point is that that we have a lot of different plans to flow is really something that i think in the agency that the board truth she learning engineering an engine problems should consider using i'd like to end these interviews episodes heard the way ship it handles there's wednesday that i caught isabel you senator religious indicted book and
getting audio format and souvenir ruined fond relax character so on that scenario little bit funny some new your interests there things you like to do off o'clock old that's i developed quite an lot of new hobbies during her colored unlock the the suffers a law on the big keyboard nerd alter the bill keywords b. i. bill thousand keywords so i got into that holly huxley during cohen and it's like a rabbit hole once you get in you don't get on something disqualifying most recent private hobbes was you could say
i'm very interested in playing table tennis in which also recently pick up again as the bug is sports so i guess it's basically a private interests and i need recently is finished oh my master degree is sending data science but always have been working on the side as it is scientists and marketing companies before depth of the motor company and stuff like two years will add that so yeah besides it just being my word it's also my private interests and drew my time off from work or else it just we'd like to read
research papers seawater mute of feldman's was allowed to enter watered latest trends alone machine learning and it's a good patients so yeah i think that both sums up my pride in the morning or interest on the topic of the master's degree this is something the law my listeners are rare in sudan and says is so fresh gee maybe you might have snared sector and they wanna know what amount of added value his master's bad over bachelors to finding a job and innocence as sex a good question receive is often popping up on right
this will lot of people are asking this question and i think it really depends on on your situation so thick for example someone who comes from computer science or from a sadistic background or from any mathematical background if if if you wanna get into d. the papers signed sealed and have a bachelor in one hour still owes three so absurdly computer science mathematics innocent to six personally i don't things and master degree is in cages
i don't specifically is then gonna serve much going for you because in gay assigns the most important cordis understanding that the mathematics behind it and the technical part i think is easier in some cases is easier to learn that on the mathematical in statistical court so i would say a few come from the ground where you have had all of us manage statistics nothing but computer science at the same thing you basically have a combination between mathematics and
and technical subjects of thinking and those cases the decreed in your master green designs is that i really had much kill you for at least i can add more philly done when you stuart exploring the beside herself and what is also wanna see iranian lot of people in the day the sarsfield are not necessarily people who get the message agree but they have some technical or mythical mathematical background and they were interested in this signs and they just read papers and and and and did course
i'm calling themselves and i think at that point with such a bare ground a massive agrees are gonna add more affiliate themselves and however a needle in my bachelor's was more like a business and economics focus of course irony had it interesting data and the nitride to always combine what i've learned in my bachelor's whitman today the field blood could convert the film for durden like economical mathematics and statistics and business
mathematics as the six and for me it really felt through basically frank up my technical knowledge as well as mine are more specific they assigns mathematical related dogs so i think if you come for background it's like this is really did i think it really helps to have a mass of the green bay the size of that sway wanna go to and then ultimately you end up with his prefer combination between understanding the business side and the day aside one of those three you said toussaint
as the sake of pure science statistics or around and then animus in the third option is is machine learning work were due to science as an actual master's degree yeah which of those three would you date if your intent is this signs urging the sounds like a honestly c. is the right answer but it doesn't seem that that's necessarily so you have a bigger masters for good sized shaman would you go to pure science math spats bird is cents an hour personally i've thing
i would choose for stats steady for mathematics and the sock and as a weapon with the conclusion is coming to you know it's almost like machinery instance band is sciences you'll know what my calm next as the glue that field the future yeah but there's old years old faithful all the time just that's that's true and i think in the end flaking you understand the solutions the new bills of the best and how would boards if you notice that some of them out
behind it and what i feel with these sometimes fees from what i've seen of forces depends for university group but what i've seen from ladies' day the signs of bachelors that might sound like they're very related to the subject but sometimes i think they stayed too broad so they don't reproach upon like a deeper and deeper mathematics and statistics behind it and of course in the end it also comes down what subjects you choose like the selective study after enduring your bachelors in your master
which can also really change with what kind of molecule finished as agrees but i think the statistics would definitely be the best backbone to have one going into wanted to send troops i agree agree end i've seen water grin on africa's long line and end up in universities one thing i recommended a long time ago and i would stand by and we're just because i haven't kept up with that slid open ended and complex witness ron was all when nancy asked george were
to tack on line master's degree was really in expenses with five thousand rape us marshal but for masters we sell ripper an slick want two years masters on line and so is a really attractive option option as opposed to the boeing says bedecked universe ye guests code now servers on one knee when you find that there's i mean those new gasoline and agrees those are really going to march in the way of credibility and the job market n. n. is like traditional university for rationing is seen
to be something um no brownies there's with degrees offer online maybe by a well-known universities but see the new me on an author like an accelerated program more yes and i've seen him coined by like advertising for for those kind of degrees lot especially on on platforms when read it and friends as far as i know like yet to be very careful with with addict reclaim the dismal lot of those online agrees they seem very attractive because of their prices
however would you really have to look out for is that it's not gonna be a show what i've read from it is that a lot of fun people took those courses they had barely any interaction with professors marauder students and personally i think the size the courses itself when i found brief l. u. bowl or during my message reason go fifty percent of my message agree with your immortal soul so they can go to university physically and it's also where realizes that even more is the interaction but
green you animal nourished eugenics is freak is is the smallest as important as the courses itself because everyone there has a different background and you can barely color from one another i've had a lot of his crew project in an needing full daughter she runs during which i'll learn so wunsch new stuff that i didn't even get to intercourse is itself says because they were for exempt from a computer science background or from a mathematical background i think and that's a huge component that you missed
when you take these online degrees on the other hand i have seen some repute wants that offer course is strong and free credible professors i know for example that this eventually freed but i think most of what the patriot mit is publishing also lot of these people running lectures and if i compared those two deep lectures that i got regarding the burning in my university is that the current them there is pretty much the same
do anything you're missing out on us like e. king friction with baby daughter she was under professor in the practical exercises a big and so what i would advise is to really dig deep into what the curriculum is to offer an accord of people behind it and also just check sources like read it war annie forest because there are a lot of people that she heard their opinion about he's gonna fall one agrees but often is really a hit or miss lewis on the river completing on sons and inoperable really learning in it
in which you would never when you just watch figures on youtube as sometimes there are those that are really good and i think that the beatles up until the organization was hunted i'm glad i asked you those questions come up with some insight on on the top and yet because this is huge discussion that's going on on rented for example as well what a lot of people as for the way they need the master degree in and i found this online version or does online degree isn't really necessary or valuable up for me to read for
no my career but under the tree lot of discussion going on about these laws tried to what kind of keep up with that those thing 'cause i find it quite interesting to see where those developments are going to this especially in the field of data sounds in education is changing very fast and curriculums also for white universities themselves or changing every two years now a new one another vote for nafta that area learned has flown by torture deepening you know you're sick who knows what comes next
yeah i desire member line enduring minute messer jury like the focus of a lot alike on machine on and you can but it's now or were decommissioned thing to more like reinforced and learning is as that of the next step i'm not mrs of the next step up its level of wood more advanced than your d. c. the nurses shift going on to push for all suffered those kind of subjects this was a wonderful wonderful area and so are we had a really enjoyed it so i think it

processing it's taken us so long i apologize for that we're gonna discuss work for a neural networks or a man's word to becky in word and outings in various architecture details like the l. s t m long and short term memory angie or you did work for unit cells after preparing for this episode i realize indeed is the video mall fight for soul to see how far we get in this first episode deep natural language processing i mentioned it for deep learning has revolutionized an
nope he too incredible degree work for neural networks have common with sword and porch pillaging the entirety of an l. p. leaving no stone on towns are n. n.'s are incredibly powerful and versatile in an elk he why is steep learning so plentiful the penalty there's a couple reasons the first thing the complexity and new wants of language remembered from the neural network episode that neural networks and people earning shine
particularly in circumstances are extremely complex by comparison to circumstances of her very simple predicting that cost of a house in a housing market is very likely be simple linear model linear regression fits just fine but predicting whether there is i kept our word tree in a picture is too complex for linear model to handle it so image processing is really entirely the domain of people earning and convolution all neural networks specifically with which will be two later what is the basis of
complexity in mushy learning malls it really boils down to the fact that certain features in your day that combining your model in some way it is nonlinear so very simple example t. is to try to protect the salary somebody you might use their degree their field of study where they live race gender always things will feel the steady and degree are two very important features more talking about somebody sorry but they're not additives their multiplication they combine together to
create a new feature which is field and agree with underscores the multiplication if you have a bachelor's in computer science that combo will make you more money than if you have a bachelor's of english as so we don't consider them separately it's not bachelors plus the english versus bachelors plus computer science now if you knew this ahead of time as we do with field of study in degree you could manually combine those features together and still use your linear model like linear regression this is called feature engineering men
lee combining your features and in putting them into your model for very simple situations like this yes that works fine both very complex situations you need the machine tool learn how features combine enough for a new rome at work guys that explicitly when neural network is best at doing is combining features together so in this particular case you could just around the gate into neural network and it would have learned in it's thin layers to combine field of study and agree together multiplication what is called feature learning n.
there are multiple layers of feature combinations that when you actually have to go with deep learning in the case of image processing there are indeed multiple layers of feature combinations the first layer of feature combinations is combining pixels together to form lions so began the layers lawyer pixels those are all your features the first in layers job is to combine black pixels together or dark pixels together to create lines are borders are edges and in this set
in hidden layer combines those lines together to form a objects like i.
A. a. b. c. a b. a c. b a. a  b. A. a B. c a. B. C. a A. B+. a. C a. A B. A C.
's years mouth and nose and in the final layer the output layer of this neural network the small fry where percent chon is going to be a buyer classification as to whether this is the face or not you need that second thin layer because you need to combine things heretic lee is not sufficient to combine just the pixels into lines in order to make a production you have to make one more combination adding new layer
the language is just this way language is so new wants them complex first off things do indeed combined they have to become mine would you say this movie was good pursue this movie was not good not been good combined multiplication lead such that it is now the different feature then not and good consider separately says sequences of words should be combined in such a such away on top of that you might have a second skin layer which could combine constructs of words
as they relate to each other you might even think of this as syntax tree parsing now making a recurring neural network with two hidden layers in the architecture that doesn't give you syntax tree parsing her say we don't know what it gives you neural networks are black boxes what's going on inside of us in layers is impossible to interpret all weekend into it is generally the things are being combined in one layer and then those combinations are being combined
another layer and however many layers deep you wanna go the depth of your hierarchy is sort of the depth of the complexity of the situation and hands and that seems intuitively to be like syntax tree parsing if we're talking about language but it may not necessarily be that way under the hood in the black box of the neural network but that is just to say that language is complex language is new wants in words come by mrs way that would be impossible feature engineer see you want to feature lauren m. by way of deep lar
in an high arctic lee combine it soon tactically so that debt indeed learning is significant and helpful that's language complexity the other big benefit of deep learning in the space of an elk he is by way of something called n.'s tech and models that we saw this small last episode on machine translation in shallow traditional machine translation we would have multiple models all stacked together all feeding into each other who'd have syntax tree parsing we have to
coding indeed going by way of bees in statistics we had alignment models and we have language models nice all displayed in together they were written separate we maintain my different maybe teams are individuals on a project for a company an important leave shrinking one of these models does not feed into the training of other models you have to train your models independently and danced and model like rucker neural network that bar n. n. is all you need him
sheen translation that lorena and learns everything you need and therefore you only need to train your wanna organic and so open and stick and model is a model that is written maintained in trains all in one mile so deep learning and neural networks bring whole lot to bear in natural light which processing now the first at understanding r. n. n.'s is making this distinction between a sequence models like to mark off models from prior episodes
and on sequence model sings worry to snap your fingers and outcomes in output by the support vector machine or logistic regression class a fire you input something and out comes your classification or your aggression to the sequence models anderson on sequence models and we had that in our prior shallow n. o. p. episodes we had a hit mark off models mark got chains hands joints probability language models being sequence models and we had it
maximum entropy support back to machines and logistic regression being non sequence models were gonna carry this information over into world of deep learning and religious have two models a regular neural network just a neural my work and work for a neural network so horny use a regular neural network for everything that is not sequin space you snap your fingers the neural network happens and out comes out of our youth worker neural network for everything that is sequined space stay
step step step step we're we're we're we're we're in a sentence or even send send send some sense in a paragraph if our task is the sequence of times that's for you sir replied your network and by the way sequence models as we've been discussing another word for this is called heinz series forecasting to find series models because they're too kind steps were talking about language we're we're we're we're doesn't seem like times that's inside words that but they really are too high in steps and sequence mon
also for trying series modeling time series forecasting is useful natural image processing it's useful in whether production models and it's useful and stock market forecasting anything that has a sequence of times that's so return your own met works for c. quince paste and opie tasks and regular neural networks which we're also going to call the neural networks or artificial neural networks or mall tyler perception on its case you didn't see these words all the time referring to a regular vanilla bean
rome at work that's deep neural network for d. n. an artificial neural network work day and an mo filer curse at tron arcana l. p. and specifically by comparison to recurrence neural now works are going to be calling them in this episode feed forwarded neural networks feet forward meaning you input your input it feeds forward for you than you on through the thin layers and out through the out band's blown way we understand that i compare
son to new recruits neural networks is help or n. n.'s work so this is how on and work in our hands we take in our input a word we're gonna be taking in one input step at a time we're we're we're we're so we're on were won we take inward won as arkin put it enters the hidden layer something happens in that black box in that neural network in layer and out comes an outlet kill us they were translating from english to spanish so i say hello howry
doing it wants to translate to glaucoma stocks so step one is entering a hello and out calms olaf now step to we moved to the second english word how hello how how goes into the neural network it goes into this saying that neural network okay and there are not multiple neural networks for every time step is only one neural network that will be reduced for every scene
time step this time through the neural network it takes in his input is second were how hands the output of the prior hats whole lot sell it takes into the inputs second word and deed output of the prior pass the first output in other words to him later loops back on itself there is a circle arrow coming out of the thin layer and back into the
they had layer and the second outwit the second time step is cuomo very interesting so we have one neural network a regular old neural network it seems like but with one tiny little twist and that is that an additional can put that comes into the thin layer in addition to the regular input is the output of the prior pass it in your own i'll work with the circle luke luke being bitten we're back onto itself and it's
and spin your aunts or functions they can be signal way functions or can it each functions were rectified linear units etc these are actually computer functions either mathematical function to get executed on the computer says it's calling itself will recall that in computer science as for courage and it's function calling itself and itself in itself can itself until we get to the very end of the sentence and then we backtrack her way up the stack anger results as recur janelle swelling color work
currents neural network and that is by contrast to eight feet forward neural network fee for being the opposite glove with current now we get short third step hello how are you weren't hello how can our i. r. a. are ye we feed all are into the thin layer arkin put layer is our it is fed into our hidden layer can spin comes from the last step veit how we get out
put thoughts far okay so what said last time there were taking the output of the prior step in it as an input is a bit of an over simplification what we're really doing actually it is all language model task for member language models do this kind of probability thing sequence from left to right you like multiplying george probabilities or running through markets chain or something like that we're kind of doing it is to colleen our way through the output sequins and that sobbing
and it came to this pass as an input and what they can and do it's going to look at all are gay and if we were not using the prior inputs feeding them back into the thin layer they were just output sewn in seoul and the direct translation of all are from english to spanish the decimal we want we want the language to be complexes smart so be it carries with it sort of this meaning vector that it has been building up as it when along through the center
it's an it's sees all lock como and it knows that combined with are what we have thus far this to how leave after the we've built top of our translated seconds thus far combined with all our in english should not to give us a stone what we should maybe do probably stickley has learned in the thin layer of this neural my work is wait wait because what comes next is what's important we're going to see
skip this word to move on to the next word you we pass said in as inputs to begin where remember this is all the same neural network we used over and over at each step in calmness this vector just how weak it has been being passed we curse of lead into this thin layer incomes that tally vector combine it with you and how calm space stocks because the words we've translated thus far plus the crime we're we're looking at will give us that word and so we learn that
like cities and nuances of things like mata fire words and sarcasm and all these things were words combined in a special way that brings new meaning to the output information is carried through the rucker neural network through each time step by wind out putting words into looping that back into the thin layer for the next time stand the way this for colonel no work works makes it all language
model language model from a prior episode so an r. n. n. is the language model shall we haven't been put sequence of the words he eats these words of one word of the time and spits out some stuff one word of time including if necessary skipping the word because that's going to combine with the next word and some special way as we saw with or you becomes s. stocks know was the sound like this sounds a lot like a hidden markoff model from a prior episode indeed and such
ollie anything they're very similar i think of this formulation of record neural network as like the deep learning equivalent of a hen markoff model now of course the record neural network because it is a neural network with a thin layer of new lawns or in lady or is it will be substantially more complex and new wants and powerful than a hidden markoff model you'll learn that mort intricacies benefit marked off model could learn
out here is what's really cool about our current neural network this architecture that i just described to you can replace every single tax cut we described in the prior episodes we didn't put the sequence of work work work work work work and for every word weekend i'll put a part of speech tag bird noun pronoun adverb right part speech tagging that was one task where we could use to mark off models or we could use maximum entropy models were
report back to machines well we can use the ricker neural network for won the r. n. n. will learn attributes of the word that make it some part of speech intricately in the depths of its black box within it's thin layers but who he will also be considering sort of it's location semantic lead in the sentence that thus far by way of that luke structure it sees where it's sadness sentence as has been how lead from
left to right bringing us to this point and it considers that hasn't been put that is a feature a factor hoping determine what part of speech this word is so the more complex new weinstein shirk its version of parts speech tagging one model the rucker neural network to be used instead of any number of models we might have using prior episodes such as the head market model maximum entropy support actor machine etc are speech taking names and city where kidney
should we input or sequence of words and al calm steady number of names and cities okay so many outputs will be skipped and certain outputs will calm directly with its name to entity we say steve jobs invented apple it's acting little bit like a kid markoff model we're going steve jobs for collecting those two together how pudding as the second outwit her son steve jobs k. we go to the third input invented and a determines that that word by way of the war itself
in combination with where we are in a sense thus far by way of that loopy structure is not a name to entity and so we skip that the fourth input apple combined with a hidden states outputs organisation apple so the news of recur neural network to spread out named entities as well as parts of speech in this way we're using an r. n. n. like a good market model were working the words and putting out little things that we walk along the way being the inputs one word time and coping outlets any number of words
time we can also use or n. n.'s for sentiment analysis classification machine translation and every other tasks that we've artie talked about now in order to use our n. n.'s for those more complex tasks we're gonna need to re imagine r. n. n. a little bit different way and i'm going to present a version of record yeoman work hold the sequence to sequence model or alternatively and and coder de klerk model and again
yes take alone or in an instead of each word and putting out an outlet for every time step what we're going to do is scan put all of the input first from left to right gather art how we we curse of leak through the thin layer and then we will stop we've read our entire seconds from left to right hello how are you period that we stop when output anything yet we're building sort of a vector to how we being me
in full vector representation open to this point it's like r. r. n. n. is listening to us speak you say hello bob bob bob bob would succumb in his nodding it's had on okay hon ago on our hands at the very end when you stop talking it sinks a little bit and a kind of re for military thing you said in its head it builds up this meaning representation of everything you said and now they can respond to that first step was cold and coding
you and coated the sentence and now the orion and we'll see cody what it seems to be a proper response to listens to you talk to aha okay okay when you stop is like you know okay whoa was or what we were saying that there was so did depots response based on the encoding it has from what you said that the two steps are in an ankle or de klerk been another word for this is sequence to sequence you gave it a sequence and it
i'll put the sequence sega sequence and thirty color and we we use this secrecy sequence model for more complex r. n. n. n. l. p. tasks so the case of sentiment analysis or classification what the r. n. n. will do is read all the word love to write first ah okay okay okay it and what's your die and it's been like you sounded mad right that sentimental assist it will give you a predicted the sentiments once it has heard the entire sentence or a predicted class of fitch fitch
a class we're talking about sports or technology or news stuff like that classification so you can code your sequence and then you are or n. n. can outwit another sequence now you see in this case that sequence is one word it's all one item sequence we can imagine like in programming you can have a single element ray break open bracket and one item an enclosed bracket that's basically what we're doing here is creating an air raid the sequence it just so happens to be a waugh
the items sequence and then finally in the case of machine translation i posed to the problem as being a vanilla or n. n. translating the sentence word for word as we go along that's not how we do machine translation neural machine translation using r. n. n. architectures are actually sequence to sequence models and that makes more sense anyway it's a little bit more difficult to try to translate something as you're going along from left to right in
real-time then it is to listen to what the person said first think about it and and translated to spanish so the more powerful mural machine translation models use this sequence to sequence and coder de klerk architecture now so let me give you an analogy i use for understanding sequences sequins r. n. n.'s in the case of single item sequence to sequence r. n. n.'s like we saw with classification and sentiment analysis you'll need an analogy were
i'm betting the sentence as we go from left to right and the result is a single factor which is basically your class is not much to that but if we are in coding our source sentence in english okay and we want to translate it to spanish an indian code process we created a vector which is sort of this running tally of the sentence is sort of meaning vector summing up the entire sentence how could we possibly go from that
to be reconstructed sentence in spanish elected think of it like this if you've ever seen the movie boondocks saints this is big fight sequence deceased to irish guys in their american friends they're in their apartment our member exactly what happens some big flood comes out then he changed one of the brothers to a toilet in the bathroom and he brings the other brother down to the alley with a gun against his head and the first brother on the second floor of the new climate change the toilet breaks the toilet out of the grounds and throws
out the window open it lands on the floods head and the first brother jumps out the window and lands on some other five there's also to shooting in things in knocking over and people get shot is blood being splatter on walls memory runs away so there we had the sequence of actions think of that like our words word we're we're we're we're hello how are you this is our sequence of actions that comes in chains brother wanted toilet take brother to downstairs coins donegan said brother one throws toilet out of window and softens step step step steps
and by the end of this whole scene everybody runs away flees the scene there is sort of an aftermath left behind there's toilet shards and bullet holes in walls blood snatchers on the floor maybe i'm gonna left behind in a shoe over here so there's a whole crime scene left behind that is what we have been coded from our sentence the sequence of steps has occurred in this sort of crime scene has been
being built up it's like the shadow of what actually happens and by the time this whole row down is don a crime scene is left behind that is our encoded sentence now in the movie this climate investigator gumshoe guy shows up at the scene and you know he observes the whole scene all what's he's looking at floor he sees a shoe when i'm gonna some bloods matters he looks over to the right he sees all holes no wall can heal
so that the apartment and see the shattered window and so he's able to reconstruct the meaning of the sentence based on wall was left behind me and colby so right now he is the coding the and coding and in the movie i don't remember exactly how this on fold but you can imagine he walks over to some broken pair of handcuffs on the ground and he kneel down and picks up and turns it over in his hands and based on his understanding of the whole crime scene
i'm buying with this step one he has made it his first word in the end coating process will lock step one wise thought chained brother wanted toilet he looked to the whole crime scene see some toilet shards except the handcuffs and constructs step wind cbc he doesn't have access to the actual events that unfolded he only has access to the crime scene saffron colored de klerk are then does it builds up a crime scene messy
coating process and then from there the key code or picks up and says i got it from here on the translate gets higher in the sense hello how are you into an entire spanish sends all local what's that's excellent so now you have a basic understanding of organic entity or loopy neural networks now how do we get these words into our organ and remember that machine learning doesn't work with tax it works with numbers machine learning is math it is lynn
around for brought statistics and calculus so we need to turn our words into numbers or vectors how do we do this in the prior episodes one representing documents in the database we represented those documents as a bag of words so each document is a role and it has a hundred and seventy thousand columns as the number of english words in the entire english dictionary and there is a one in the location for the word if that word is present in this day
hakim and so eight hakim it is just the vector mostly zeroes and won yes that word is present we call this the sparse vector because there is a spore city of winds and amy jordi of zeroes now the equivalent representation for words not documents but words individual words themselves is that the word would be a vector any would have a wine in that column on that word itself okay so what would be all zeroes
a hundred and sixty nine thousand nine hundred nine nine zeros all heroes except for one which is in the location of that words call on is a sports vector as well because it is mostly zeroes and very few wines but specifically only wanda wanda and so we call this a one hot vector so sparse vectors mostly zeros someone's a one hot vector is a sports factor that is only one that won the one hot
actor so if we had this sentence hello how are you emma's pretend that those are the only words in our entire dictionary there would be for columns hello how are you and if we're looking at the word hello than the first call 'em would be won and the next three columns of the zero in our word hello that's how we would represent our word as a one hot vector now this representation of word does not carry it any significance any meaning any semantic importance is almost
just an arbitrary representation of all work but you might as moses have a u. u. whitey some serial number for every word the way that we represented as one hot vector gives it no significant that's by contrast two bags of words which have been them a little bit of significance when we represented document as a. t. f. i. d. f. bag of words we can perform at the search query by finding the documents which have the smallest
co signed similarity to or query okay so there's obviously some sort of semantic meaning in the document and our search query if we can connect them by way of a co signed similarity but there's nothing like that but we could do with the way we're thinking about words here they're just random so this actually will not hopeless in our pour in and an analogy here is in our crime scene investigation if we represented events as one hot
there's then the gumshoe shows up at the scene of the crime and on the floor there's no wind and yield down to accept the number one he looks over to the right and on the dumpsters at twenty four calf and he goes over and he picks up and turned it over his hand and he looks up at the window and hovering in the broken window is a sixty nine c. n. he's looking at ali's objects like what the hell they all need anything to him he needs objects which curie meany he needed beyond that of bloody shoe and broken the law
as he needs objects in the crime scene that means something semantic lee if he has any hope of reconstructing the crime scene in his mind so we need to do is represent words in the dictionary it's such that they carry semantic meaning it within that their representation we call this word and betting its we and better word if we can put it in vector space in a significant way so we're not talk about the word it to vet model
which is a neural network for creating word and eddings is the main mall that we use for doing such a task in an l. p. let's build us a little bit first all were in betting is the war are represented in fact your space so imagine all your words as stars in a galaxy now with our prior representation of words as one hot vectors those are just be random replaced but if the words were imbedded in order that they carried semantic meaning they
stuck on their location in space than what you would have is that all nearby words to one word would basically be synonym it's so if you found the good quote unquote docked in vector states the word good then all of the very close by dots you clean the intestines remember you clean distances physical distance all of the ubiquity in close dots to the word good would be things like excellent and best and
perfect and wonderful and then you might imagine words that are canton ams such as bad and horrible and worse and terrible would be very far away from this cloud of dots so they would you clean far that's what we're in betting is placing the word in vector space they carry significance semantic significance know what we're going to arrive that by using the word to back model to achieve this goal is something very stash
will not only will you find that synonym sparked physically close to each other you clean clothes but you'll find that certain projections kiri significance so the arrow the vector pouring from good too bad in vector space would be the same kind of arrow warning from baths two worst and wonderful too horrible and so on and classic example they use for the system is that if you been quite keen plus queen
minus man it will give you woman you will have performs vector math using when you're algebra you'll get back and arrow pointing to a dots and that guy isn't i'm betting representing the word woman seek actually do word matthews inward and addicts and so remember now you clean similarity is similarity of docks to each other physically so cinemas will have high ubiquity and similarity and co sign similarity is angle
similarity so the difference between good and bad you use that same sort of co sign metric on the other words in order to perform word math this whole concept is really cool philip is online you'll actually see the two d. or three d. representation of words always docks around each other under pseudonyms of each other and you can do projections to get the capitals of various states or countries by way of analogy using co sign that chicks from the capitals of the other states and country is in all this
but now an embedded word has left a five hundred and twelve dimensions number of callens so visualize a knees words in space is impossible because that's five twelve the so we can project that down to two deep or three d. by way of something called feed sneed see a hyphen s. and a. b. which stands for it he distributed stochastic neighbor and betting that is essentially the same thing
the principal component analysis it's boiling are large dimensional vectors down two small dimensional vectors so basically think of t. speed and p. c. a. has essentially the same thing they usually you're gonna be using t. snead for visualization purposes so these word of the actors have some number of columns that's the end bedding a dimension some number of callens usually let's say five hundred and twelve basically the number of dimensions is indeed the
mount all moved generalization you wanna boil this down to write smaller dimensional word vectors smaller dimensional i'm betting its means more general bowl less accurate word representations and higher dimension all word i'm betting is means less general but more accurate that is over faded were in that it's okay so our goal is to put words as docks in space with significance we call this an bedding
the word any type of machine morning model we will use to perform that task is called the vector space model v. s. am a model would put something in vector space and the way we're going to do this with words is by learning their contacts that's how urban will learn the semantic and bedding of work is it's context so certain words show watkins certain contexts
over and over and over so when i say this is the soda drink or the busy proctor ink or i like to drink soda and i like to drink hop coca cola is a good soda coca cola is a good pop you have learned by contacts by the context of the second step that word is presents that those two words are very similar to each other they may be complete synonym score they may just be very similar words to each other so that's how we war
earn took place words invective spaces by learning which words share the same context and where will get these contexts is from whenever pore pore always have available relief just download all of wikipedia and just go through every word word by word by word by word by word look it's contacts with the next words contact with the next words context and will learn what context every word it's easy ian so we're learning word i'm betting is based on their hind
tax there's two different ways we can do this one approaches called predictive methods and affording use with war two vet and will order to do there is we're going to try to predict the context given the word or predicts the word given the context and another one is called count based methods and these don't do any sort of machine learning these urges mathilde predict anything when you do is you lay all words out and columns in all wars al in rows c. have the whole english dictionary a hundred and seventy thousand by
a hundred and seventy thousand gay and you count all the words corcoran says with each other and put that in those two words crossed cell and then you do some way your elder brother paul while some coal current stuff and then you have your embedded context matrix we're not in use that approach i will talk little bit about that but first let's talk about the predictive methods mainly in our case new role probably stick language models like i said the goal is to predicts the context of the word
or to predicts the word given the context so we're trying to learn more in bedding space on their contacts and we're gonna use a model cold war two vet word to back it is a neural network which will earn his skin bedding matrix based on word contexts so was going to do is make a context prediction using a neural network feed forward pass and learn from its mistakes using something called the noise contrast it this
a nation lofts function remember every machine learning moll has lost function and then use a great set by way of that propagation back through the network to fix it there are so we're to that is a neural network is learning that the word and bedding this for every word in english dictionary by predicting it's context and optimize thing it's parameters if it made an error as two types of context production methods you can either take the word you're looking at
in a jungle words the cassell matt you can take the word you're looking at and try to predict the surrounding words so we're looking at cats in the sand since the castleman matt in this case what's called this get grandma call we're trying to protect the surrounding words blank blank blank blank that blank which i predict all those words the opposite of that is trying to predict the word given the context so if we park at the word cat in our window we will look
at the blanket sat on the mat and try to predict that that word is kennedy cat this is called the continuous bag of words approach for c. bal you can use either of these approaches when you're trying to protect your contacts year skip grandma foresee bow again that is context from word versus word from contacts you don't have to get hung up in the details is pros and cons versus dataset size most people you skip graham cell
as far as you're concerned skip gramm is the only thing that you care about so our word to that model is a feed forward neural network is trying to predicts context words sir rounding the current we're we're looking at that is the state gramm approach we're going to go through wikipedia one word it's time we look at one word which record it was our round it we obviously made some error and so we use this noise contrasted estimation watts function
in order to back to propagate or gear or through the neural network fixer parameters move on were to that neural network to try to predict this stick grandma context around the new word we're looking at we make some error that propagate allies through our neural network adjust our parameters next word we do this over and over and over and over and over and so we have built up the table the word and deadbeats what we have in the end is called an m. bedding and matrix
every word is a role every call on it is somewhat nebulous and getting it to mention it doesn't really matter what matters is in the end of all of your words are stars in a galaxy whose position in space holds significance okay so that's the word toback model now like i said that approach is called a predictive that vector space model meaning we're trying to predict the context situation that by contrast to hate
and based vector space model or distribution old semantics model and the way this works is we lay out all the words in english dictionary rose by columns and we count in every cell the number of times they need to words roll by call on coal occur with each other in a context window then we have a matrix of coal occurrence keiko occurrence matrix and we will use a bon jovi linear algebra on that matrix
things like principal component analysis or latent semantic analysis or singular value decomposition you'll see these used in machine in la p. c. a l. s. a. s in the deep in order to haul out the i'm betting still rack to leave from the math from that co occurrence matrix and we call this small the globe model g l o v with a capital v. the global factor
or representational words and this has various pros and cons versus war two vet usually pros and cons with all these situations boiled down to amount of training didn't you have come out of lamb speed and other things you may see glove used were discussed in the wild but as far as you're concerned reconstitute a state of them bedding words in vector space the only thing you care about his word to vet ma
wall which is in your own iwerks using this get gramm approach will that was a lot of information just you and that our words that was eighty feet forward neural network on those snap your fingers now come the thing we can use if the forward network for other work related tasks like a part of speech tagging and names and city recognition but you'll find a think that record neural networks are preferred for those tasks because whenever we're looking at
they were were trying to determine apart speech remained entity and we have the prior context of the sentence thus far which actually helps determine the part speech tag or names and sexy and soul really the main place you see the standard feet forward neural network in an l. p. is the inward to back isn't coming out with bark and bedding matrix of words everything else tends to be organic and the mighty work
i'm yeoman work itself let's step all way back now we have gone through all of wikipedia and placed all forwards in vector space these are now imbedded words rather than one hot words so now they carry semantic meany now we can use those to take into or or n. n. n. coder so that our de klerk has something no work with so this scene of the crime were the gum shoes standing by giant bright flash of light happens he
resides in staggers backwards when the white wears off he looks and sure enough there's a gun on the floor and a bloody shoe and some bullet holes no wall as some broke in the toilet shards on the grounds the inputs carried meaning into the encode or or unmanned and so what is handed off to the d. coder step also carries meaning or n. n.'s anne words to that now that's the end of this episode but that's not the end of or n. n.'s we're gonna talk about
traditional neurons and they're used the n. r. n. n.'s namely rectified linear units we lose as well as what's now state of the art cells not neons in an oar in and cold l. s. t. m.'s cells were long and short term memory cells by contrast something called g. r. e.

alarm when you back propagate your training error in recurring mural networks soul talk in the next episode about little bit more of the nitty gritty architecture technicalities of or n. n.'s as used in an l. p. this episode gave you a very basic label lands and the fact that orangutans basically replaced everything in an l. p. to bring state the arts deep learning to the space now for learning
people earning an l. p. first i'm going to recommend a handful of articles for you to read a very popular one which is called unreasonable effectiveness of organic and still very easy read very visual is more conceptual all on this episode and then another couple particles of her little bit more technical from there your next step is just to learn people earning deep and help he and oar in and start a section of love deep warning
rock or so whether it's deep learning book got bored or facts not ai the traditional deep learning resources that i've been recommending r. n. n.'s will be inside of those main resources as one or two or three chapters so just continue along you are basic deep learning learning curriculum in order to learn the details for deep and l. p. and finally there's a great stanford itunes you course c. s to twenty four and we
his deep and l. p. by christopher manning chris manning it if you'll recall is the co author of the main and shallow learning and l. p.'s book that i've recommended are episodes as well as the u. tube series on shallow learning him and dan sharansky but then you to play list together this is basically part two of them you to play west this is the deep learning equivalent of that u. tube series and is a brand-new it's i think it's two thousand seven
team and it's not as two thousand and sixteen it actually replaces a prior stanford indeed an l. p. course called c. s to twenty four b. which is taught by richard soldier so if you've seen that one floating around c. s t twenty forty stanford deep an old he needed curious skip that wand and do this one instead because it is a emerged and updated version of that class with chris manning's material c. s to twenty four and

opie is the second episode of deeper than opie or n. n.'s marina cover a few fine points about are immense will talk about bi directional or a man's vanishing an exploding gradient problem of back propagation and it's solution through l. s. t. m.'s orgy your use let's start with the review of organic hands because i think that last episode with a little bit fast and so on make sure that you understand are enhanced completely before we move on so
and people earning we use neural networks and there are various flavors of neural networks for different tasks the vanilla neural network also call 'em all tyler perception on or a fee for network or usually just the neural network is used for sort of general tasks general classification or regression problems so if you wanted to use the neural network for predicting the cost of the house and some market you'd probably use a vanilla fee for neural now work or classify
it's something is this saturday other thing you'd use the neural network then there's the convolution all neural network t. c. n. n. or consonants which are traditionally used for the image related tasks categorizing images for example as cat dog virtually and then we have sequins base tasks kind steps steps of the overtime mit things like whether production trying to figure what the weather's maybe tomorrow based on what the weather has banned the last three hundred sixty five
days or stock market production or as we've been talking about natural language processing or sends this is sequence of words through time the premier time series deep learning our rhythm is the replied neural network and so we use our n. n.'s for deep and l. p. now real quick beg you wanna make a mention of reinforcement learning which is also something you might use force sequence based machine learning problems we have
or smut learning recall is the third category of machine learning models we have supervise learning which is the majority of things we've talked about throughout the series you train them all to do something or recognize something train the model to pick up some pattern you get a trading day which comes with labels in that war is the patterns to generate labels on its own unsupervised learning is learning at patterns in the dado with our label so for example clustering data points in
space as simply things are near each other based on their features now be unsupervised learning and finally we have reinforcement learning which is sort of the entry point into a night proper reinforcement learning is the task of learning what actions to take over time in order to maximize something some reward function we call it so as you can see reinforcement learning is also applied to time series how
asks every car neural networks for deep learning oriented times series machine learning we also potentially have reinforcement learning and you can use deep learning in reinforcement learning a thing called the cue networks so before i go on or discuss the differences between these two camps or n. n.'s or g. q. networks supervise learning or reinforcement learning which do you take when the thing that you would use reinforcement learn
for is when you need tool error in what actions to take over time in order to maximize our goal so if we think about natural language processing there doesn't seem to be some sort of analogy for that in this case looking at sequences of words how might you try to let the algorithm train itself may be what words to generate next or what actions to take that generates awarded nor to maximize some weak value based gold it doesn't seem to be anything it
makes sense in this case whereas with supervise learning your training the r. n. and explicitly on sequences of words that if you try it on hello how are blank it knows to generate you as a max were in sequence it knows that because you fed it gobs of texts degas from various court for like wikipedia or on my conversations and it has seen the word you calm after the sequence hello how are all over and over and over and over it
labels data therefore supervised and if it's very well in an l. p. reinforcement learning would be a good fit for video game again i'd botsford sample they're trying to kill the good guy that's their goal and have some sort of measure of how well they're doing which is gonna be maybe your hit points bar and have some actions that they could take it any point in the game thus far not the sequence of steps sequence of states namely up until this point all budget stuff has happened steps that
step step step the good guys down various things in various other characters in the game have been various things so is the next best action to take given your current circumstances is the actions themselves that the reinforcement learning how grim news to learn how to perform the maxim is asian of killing the good guy so those are two extremes and l. p. n. b. okay mckay on it that make orangutans verses de que networks for time series tap
it's kind of an obvious what metal glass harp about something that i think is maybe a little bit less obvious stock market productions so this i think is a great case where that line is a little bit fuzzy between whether you use supervise learning in or an aunt or reinforcement learning in a deep que network if we were using aren and what we would do is sort of try to learn to shape of a stock graf unless it were trying to build a trading bloc we want to learn
whether to buy or sell stocks in order to maximize our profits over time they have a graphic goes up and down up and down the whittle up man at the peak of the hill before you start going back down you'll want to sell stocks generally because they're going to lose valley it's your cash out your maximizing we have right now and don't lose the value at the bottom of the next frocks as the graft begins to creep upward you want to buy stocks now there
she and our production is gonna be that if the goal of them out so we're going to gain in the value of our holdings through return on investment so we might you was in or an end to build a model of the stock graf specifically what would be doing is we're aggression predicting the next steps value on a graph in numerical value on a graph spelling bee regression based our end and that we would train at one years and years of historical
stocking and and having played with the stuff myself he can actually get some pretty decent representations some pretty accurate models but then from there except you to decide what to do your behalf to build into your code a trading strategy you're gonna have to cody in the system that's what it looks like we're going downwards based on a major down take in the next regression in france and yarn and then you might sell your stocks
it looks like the next predicted value is very high and we are to furlough than you might buy stocks so you're building in the action you not believe into the machine nine model you're writing isn't python code calling some eighty odd for example the model simply spinning out a value the regression another thing you could do with an orion and it is classification you can actually tag dots on the graph points where you would classify this point has cell
live or holds so you'd have to have some previous know how about the trading and stock graphs and made east dillon says the more you can click on a graph and mark eight points as a point where you would sell buyer hold those in the u. or three classes and now the machine learning our room the recurring neural network will learn to classify points on a graph has one of those three classifications buy sell or hold so the prior case of regression based ariana and our law
asked me you're on the output layered would be a linear units like linear regression the case of classification our last neuron would be a soft max units which is a malt like class logistic regression unit so you'd use logistic regression for by mayor classification and soft max is malt psych class would just occurred russian so that's how we might use an orion and to work with stock market time series day that in order to protect whether we should bio
whether we should sell or just the numerical next step and an arc hold behind the scenes would actually act on that information inward to make the decision to buy or sell in reinforcement learning on the other hand the model actually learn on its own whether to buy or sell you give it the goal of maximizing profits so all you do see give a goal you say make a lot money and don't lose a lot money so the end goal is a high dollar value you give us a
actions it can take those are by solemn hold and then uses let loose what the algorithm worms specifically is what actions to take when you teach at the trading strategy that you buy when you're alone you sell one your high or anything along those lines using supervise learning methods know you let loose with the gold and you'll learn sinus cold weather to buy sell or hold given where is on a graph so that's the difference between
supervised time series stuff and reinforcement learning one learns numbers are classes and the other lawrence actions and indeed for an elk he'd supervise time series models is the ticket not reinforced when at least not i know of and specifically r. n. n.'s are the deep learning model for time series so neural networks for general staff c. n. n.'s for teenage stuff or n. n.'s for c.
it's stuff and let's go over what our amanda's row quick we have two types of our hands we have the vanilla r. n. n. which takes in an input and spits out an outlet for every time step mount the trick of this what differentiates it from a regular neural network five neural networks left to right is that the thin layer loops back on itself is worker says it sold the neural network so let's say we have fi
i've time stamps time step one we see it and put an end up with an outlet time step to we see it in input and it takes in the additionally the output of last time step out put him out what time step three we see in and put it takes in the running tally all the past to find steps thus far and outputs in output so we go left to right conceptually the best i actually would happen to actually
happens is one you're all male work the loops back on itself the thin layer luke's it's out the back into it's been put at the regular old or an end things you'd use this for for example are part of speech tagging and mean density recognition part speech teddy you didn't put word in outcomes i tag labored adverb now an adjective etc input word outcomes attack input word outcomes attack now accordingly you could use a raid
your neural network for this incomes awarded out comes a tag but we do want to cure east room of the system the context of the sentence thus far we wanna sort of build on meaning of the sentence we've been reading from left to right and didn't put that in with the word that we're looking at right now because the contacts will the fact that tag were appointed for so that's the magic of an arn man who takes in the prior steps to aid in the classification above the car
it's that al puts a part of speech tag so that is a one to one mapping every word gets a car speech had input output input output you may have a date many too few mapping like named entity recognition the sentence steve jobs invented apple would be named density person named eighty percent nothing named as the organization so how do we account for that nothing that blank space in a traditional r. n. n. we're just now
put some point symbol some like the letter poll is common or zero or an all or something like that so you didn't put steven out cons mayne n. c person be a good jobs and it would combine that with the last outlet and output name that's the person you didn't quit invented in you you combine that with the fact that there were two person that name and these are this annual output blank these are sort of simplistic or any hands i call them the no law or an aunt
it's one twist to this architecture they didn't discuss in the last episode is that we have been reading that movie sentences from laughs for rights to inform the decision at any time step that's well and good but sometimes stuff that comes after is also informative we can accommodate for that's by way of the structure called a bi directional or an ann what it will do is it will read the input sequence from
left to right and that will come in as an input being in that the decision being made at that step along with the actual input asked that additional eight eight thirty and what will be coming in from the right so the sense will also be read write still left so the sentence is being read left right and right to left like arrows coming from the left and right in a meeting in the middle at the current clients that an arrow coming from the ball
and that's our actual input word we're looking at the current time step those three inputs all combined together to come up with an outlet so an example with this might be useful with sand saying the phrase george's my friends or so white fox will of thing that came after friends the sequence of words that came after friend completely negated everything i'd said thus far so reading from left to right is well and good up into the pointed friends were building sort of omni
main factor by it turns out what comes after completely reverses the meaning of the sentence thus far and i would've known that unless i'd seen the park after warren matt so as the bi directional r. n. n. does is it considers what came before what comes after so regular are then goes left rights in time and common use cases for that would be part of speech hanging in the intensity recognition a bi directional r. n.
and takes input also from the right going left so whenever times that the rats will meet you in the mail from the right and from the left in order to help with your output and you might also use a bi directional r. n. n. for parts speech tagging or name density recognition it may increase the sophistication of the model you would try of the mill are then and then you also tried a bi directional are nan and you look at your evaluation metrics and see which one performs better and if the bike rack
lauren and performs lot better with not a whole lot of after computer crime then you'd use that instead you can't always use a bi directional r. n. n. it's not objectively a better solution for example sometimes you don't have the future date like if you're trying to protect stock market values you exist in the present you have all the day of the past and you have nothing of the future so you can't use a bi directional r. n. n. similarly with weather pattern productions that all
the weather for prior days but you don't have the future to you don't use a bi directional aren and so there were two flavors of our n. n.'s right there when is the no-one and sort of maps inputs that outputs directly and another is bi directional as same thing at matt simplistic outputs directly however it also considers future times that information these two by comparison to the third type of our n. n. which is calling sequence to sequence model organ and coder de klerk
model and what this does is you we'd get your sequence of steps you do all of your processing with your aren and we'll help put anything york output anything for each time step you just listen says listen and listen and listen and listen and when you're down listening when the sequence of steps is beyond we've heard the entire sense honor and then you stop anything and then you respond to you have to hear everything first sobel listening phase is cold and coating
your encoding your sentence and the outputs at each step are completely ignored them they're useless as as outputs in and of themselves but remember n. r. n. n. also feeds the output at every time stepped into the next step is an input so has is running tally it's building from left to right this is your contacts of actor or your meaning vector this is your encoding and that's what's important surf runway ali out with every time stepped in the end coating process
until the very end and you were handed a pen and coating package all old vector all that is headed to put your hands can you look at a tremor or your hands and then from this and coating you will recur schrock to a deep coating you'll come up with a response if you're chap by so you'll answer the question or you'll response to what the person said if you're chap what is your translation system then you'll reconstruct h. frenzel
mission of the sentence that was honored in the language that you translating to say you heard the sense in english and coated now listening coding in vector space that said doc somewhere in space a star in the galaxy and you can take that and it has meaning to it it has actual semantic meaning package within it you can reconstruct the meaning in spanish word for word that's what's called a sequence to sequence model u. n. code your sequence
and then you d. code that into a new sequins and and coder de klerk the sequence to sequence so this is for any task were you need to hear everything for steve you can't just translate as you go along the way like to think this is what a standard arana and you're writing and can see you can't go back in bed it's prior output stiff new information gave new meaning if something kind of messed up along the way you philip wanna go back and makes
and changes we can do that with a no on and so in banco de color is useful for situations we you need to hear everything first before you want to start writing because you're riding with pat machine translation is a good example because you're so much it's packed into a meaning back during cured and coating that if you were translating word for word is the one along you might lose some subtleties in my analogy that i use for this is let's say you're a crime scene investigator and gumshoe anna
sequence of steps happened in the unfolding of a crime that was the end coating process and i got shot and i lost issue and summing up question we ran away secrets of steps unfolded in a crime scene investigator arrives at the scene of the crimes which is york and coating the scene of the crimes are encoding you'll have access to the sequence of steps you don't actually have access to the time based crime you only have access to the aftermath what's left behind at sea and coating that the gumshoe
smart enough to know how to weaken scraps the crime from scratch cool looking just at the crime scene a little crime scene is scratches his chin and walks over and picks up a guy and so he has reconstructed step one of the deed coding sequence which is a man had gunshot and he walk so we're picks up a shoe and reconstruct step two of the deed coding sequence and also some real lost issue and so on now the sequence it yew jen ray
in the de kooning process doesn't have to be multiple i am sick appeal one step sequence so we might use this for sentiment and l. s s or classification for example you could use and then clergy color or n. n. model for either of those classification four cents med analysis where are you would want to hear everything that said first before jumping to conclusions and once you've heard everything once uganda full encoding now you can de code what is
arson is mad sad happy nervous scared etc that sends an analysis but soleil one i am sequence so imagine an earl ray brackets with one eye and it and that identity is sad its classification example again this is a perfect use case for those freed scenarios that laid out machine translation sentimental says and classification this would be a forfeit for something like stock market production or whether production your way
here everything first you wanna sort of be collecting data and making real-time estimates so there you have three types of orangutans regular old r. n. n. a bi directional r. n. n. and n. n. coder de klerk slash secrets to sequence model and remember the last piece of the prior episode dealt with her in words and some numbers because we're taxed and any machine learning model requires no
mercer vectors of numbers to work with to do with math isn't she in earnings math is just when you're outer boroughs statistics in calculus can work with texts to that see you use a model called words to mac which is gonna or regular old neural network which will convert your words into vectors by relocating words in vector space close to their counterparts context jewelry so words that show up commonly in the same types of context story
located physically knew each other and so let's all of the war to that model does it transforms your words into numbers so we can take them into the r. n. n. okay so here we are that's where we left off that i apologize that that was all just a bunch review by you kind of want to solidify it because i would really fast in the last episode and as some important steps now read talk about the problem of an oar in and it turns out i've been fooling you look into thinking that are an answer you
so wildly as is there not i think our n. n.'s are very rarely you used in their current form instead of an r. n. n. in its current form was commonly used is what's called an l. s. t. m. or g. r. u. style r. n. n. in order to build that out let's talk about the problem with an r. n. n. the prom is in screening model remember from prior episodes every machine learning model has an error function differently or five
and for different models in fact a model might have a different era function given the task so on are a man may have a different era function given the different application you're blind to whether it's named any recognition or machine translation etc so we're not begin air functions but we're function does is tell you how bad your model was doing and then you'll use training to fix that there are one separate time train train train train in slowly over time that there are found
shen starts to reduce in reducing reduced your optimize in your ear function optimize in your error reducing your error and improve your models accuracy so some error function measures how well you're doing and then you use gradient the senate's gradient descents wished how's your model which direction to move it gets parameters to every mile has incited that these parameters usually they're called fader parameters sometimes are called weights were doubly you their numbers they're cold
fish until multiplied by the input row the state foreigners are moving in space or so left or down not show through greed the sandwich just calculus says calculus tell your model which direction how far to move its fate of parameters in order to increase its accuracy namely to reduce its error by way of their function greatest sent out many models use grades and linear regression logistic regression support back to ms
jeans and yes neural now works when neural network uses great descent it's called something different called back propagation that propagation is applying breed descends to all the new alliance and in passing that mirror signal down through the ranks from right to left from that output which got some error signals using their functions as by some way off from ever remember analogy for neural network being at that company or chart starts with its employees as basic
the deed in calais air moves on to supervisors that in layer then move on from there to the boss the head honcho the company in that sea out where so we took in some input got passed through the ranks the feet forward part of the neural network lens and from the boss and the boss man looks at the results as a piece of paper his left hand he's comparing it to a piece of paper his right hand he's shifting his cigar from last train is now looking at what was predicted in his left hand with the actual value is is right here
then he shouts back through the ranks cries when i stopped by ten mil supervisors get to scrambling fixing various values in their books nerd crossing of some numbers in doing some math and the same time they turn around you shall back to their employees guys boss man says we're off by ten and a key correcting some numbers no books an employee star correcting some members in their books says gradient descent past hair piggly back through the ranks of the neural network that that propagation now a worker in neural net
work remember is sequin space the inlay or loops back on itself for every time step in our sequins whether it's a sentence of words four times that's in the stock market we're making a prediction and then we're feeding the prior production back into the next time step where we take in an input and the prior outlet for cardio my work is one neural network by looks back on itself how would that propagation worked in this case what we would do is for
did sent all the neurons send that your signal back through the neural networks just regular old neural network remember so you work the same but that is really only in the last step of the rucker neural network sequence that would be that propagating only the last step so what we do we back propagate again we just feed the air signal on through again so the forward pass of rucker neural network doing its production and in the back
forecast of rucker know my work is back propagating that they are multiple times once for every time step it's called back the propagation through time to go forward to make a production and you back propagate your errors through the neural network one storeroom time for every time step now why would that look like he would happen or charred boss and his supervisors an errand boy he's the boss would look at what's on paper and look what's on file and yelled back at the supervisors error
errors he's written a paper and a supermodel hear that and so they all start changing some numbers no books no real back to the employees error error error and now it's been next to pass back of the r. n. n. the boss gets the second to last production he made compares it to what's on file error error that supervisors all here then there'd still kind of writing in their books may look at him naked guy grimace nurse furnace weapon is for changes in a reasonable troy fascinating yell back to the employees error in the employees would pull never on mr redding
boss gets the third to last production he made new worker know my work a deal that error error in the supervisors are just pulling their hair out that practically in tears they're trying to modify numbers in the books but things are coming so fast that they just can't keep up with the biggest scribbling winds everywhere in the lead back to the employees are our in the employees just quit they say we're i'm john you can back propagate or error too many times too far back because remember when i said this is all one company one
organisation one you're all male work it just so happens to look back on itself over and over and over you can back propagate your hair too many times what happens is either called the exploding gradient where the error signal becomes tool allred basically an your fate tremors get moved too far towards infinity everything is becomes infinity as kind of like how i'd describe it here or are the opposite happened and the error signal because it was too low to begin with it's quieter and
einar inquired so to the boss man's like air air and supervisors would look what i think you said eric dyson so we so they start to announce numbers no books may whisper back to the employs her an implicit why the cup and their hands is why i can hear you that vanishing gradient problem the grain is solo that we gets back propagated over and over and over goes towards you were or becomes zero know what's the prom with this why don't we have this with a regular neural network or convolution on on a worker something like that but promised
we're back propagating are terror over and over and over and over no this isn't usually a problem for very short sequences boys are sequences become longer and longer say forty steps or fifty steps nobles be very long sentences but in the case of whether production of stock market analysis those of the very tiny sequences indeed vanishing in exploding gradient to be a very very big problem for stock market whether analysis but it turns out also actually that can help he indeed suffers for
the vanishing an exploding greedy as well so you joie play it safe and solve this problem with the solution to this problem the solution is something called an elk s. t. m. or long short term memory cell or alternatively there's a competitor called a g. or use cell or dvd we curried unit date for the most part serve the same purpose in very similar way is l. s. t. m.'s are much more common in yiddish riyadh
fines from what i understand and l. s t a m soule is sort of a general case of the g. r. u. sell so the little bit more all encompassing can handle more situations don't quote me on that but i'm alice young like mrs hughes much more than eighty are you in the industry so for now let's just focus on l. s. t. m. and you can think about you are you in the future l. s. t. m. or long short term memory sell what it dies the is the replaces the new ron
now in a week for neural networks in later soap in a neural network in your on it is just some function some mathematical function of statistical function like i said not passe said it deep learning is stacked shallow learning an example i used is a most eyewear perception of the no-one yeoman work may have as it's in your ons logistic regression basically every neuron is just live just egress and that any el pueblo y.
asked me on it in your neural now work if you're trying to do regression in it's going to be a linear regression new on just linear regression and if it's classification it's binary classification as can be logistic regression and if as some old high class classification is going to be soft max soft max this mold psych class logistic regression now he gets a little bit more complex than that lot of times these new ron's aren't necessarily logistic regression war
or what's called a signal we unit the other word for logistic regression as eighteen you're on is a signal when you in it because the signori function is sort of the crux of logistic regression cynically sig more units but they're not often signal you know sometimes and probably more often than not a neural networks we use a different function one is called a tanning each function answer similar to signal a function on to slow the different and others call it a rectified all
in your unit or re lulu which is quite different from us ignored function but these are three kamen neurons a u. might see in the wild signalling unit scanning each unit and re louis units and they have various pros and cons under different circumstances that make the math worked out given the situation you need to know that stuff right now begins at the craps out will work and i'd do in this particular situation is we're going to take out those ten each unit says
maybe in an r. n. and red take out those neurons what i'm out of the neural now work and we're going to hop in this l. s. t. m.'s sell dona alice t. m. soule is not a simple near on as such is not a function is not some mathematical equation is actually like a machine it's a little complex near on that has within it multiple neurons so you pop in the circle into your car and and you replace you work in the way your knee
ron's with this alice t. m. circle in your graft and it has on it the label l. s t m long short term memory resume again into that circle and inside of it is can have multiple little neurons one might be a matrix multiplication unit another might be a major expedition units one might be a ten h. function another mightiest ignored function etc soda machine that saddam many neural network and it has a very specific purpose the purposes in the name
long short term memory so before i talk about these units let's talk conceptually about what it's going to do each lsd am in your skin layer or however many thin layers you have is going to latch onto a specific sob sequence in sequence is going to sort of honing in on some concept within a sentence and focus on that so let's say the sense is after
we're gonna go get my aide license of the d. m. v. then i go grab some drinks with friends and i have to work the rest of the night was cut three separate things happening in that sentence it's sort of a medium length sentence so it actually indeed could suffer from the vanishing gradient problem each alice t. and sell in our bar n. n. may sort of lawrence whole latch on to sob sequences like after work i'm going to the d. m. v. at that my license to sort of like latch on to that
sean annual learn to ignore the rest then the second ellis t. m. ike latch on to the middle part bellinger grab drinks with friends so it learns to ignore everything up until this point and everything after that point to the zealous himself learn to slice and dice and says soros into sobs sequence is there more manageable which also makes for representing sentences hierarchical e. even more effective as well you might soros
in code sob chunks of a sentence and then combine those into an overall encoding rather than in coating the whole sentence as it is so that's pretty cool it can seem to learn to latch on to some sequences and it doesn't have to be as far as i understand it doesn't have to be contiguous sequences it may or may not be old to take chunks from various other parts of the sentence serve whacked on the concepts more inside the sentence he never know
really what exactly happening under the hood of the neural network because they're black boxes but this is how we might conceptually think of what analysis him does is sort of slicing a sequence it's manageable chunks edible chunks for the thief forward pass in coincidence but also importantly manageable for the back propagation pass that propagation to time because what's going to do now is when you train your r. n. n. on its error backdrop through time each spell s. t. m. will
so to listen for when it's it's own turn to train as to what sort of handling its own mini chunk of the sentence is not that's not too long so there'll at suffer from exploding are vanishing radiance it sewn up highlands of a chunk of a sense become charade on a small sequence without causing issues in the back propagation third time park so i'm alice tim souls the vanishing in exploding graham problem by sub sequencing your sequence
the more manageable chunks now how does in a bar in and work with a look like inside of that machine inside of that cell we call the cell because it's not quite in your honor and you're on it implies that a small function of small unit just as a mathematical function so we call it the cell is of the feed your honor really fat neuron have a bunch of stuff inside and what those things inside of it is they forget unit were sometimes more complex lead forget lay your home your honor dedicated
to know when when to stop listening and everything that comes after its it forgets or everything that came before where we're supposed to start listening he forgets so it's still getting the inquest every step that knows it learns went to forget what it's hearing because it doesn't matter it's not it's own dedicated chunk of that sequence in tandem with the input gate layer which decides which values it's going to up to
it's the inside of the l. s. d. m. cell and then it can at each layer does the actual copying and in the alcove where does the outlets others machinery inside as alice t. m. sell that learns to know when to start listening to get sequence going to stop listening and within that that sub sequence what values to update and how to update them and of course sending out the output cool so no sta m. makes all
murphy forward pass of our bargain and more sophisticated more complex more powerful but importantly it also prevents issues in the training phase in the back propagation through trying phase by limiting what and l. s t m cares about we've been a sentence so that it's sequins isn't too long that will cause a vanishing are exploding gradient problem like as a competitor sells to the palace t. m.
cells coolidge he or you sell the big recurring unit we'll need to worry about that for now alice t. m. is so much more common in stock in weather in language and everything that you're going to see in the near term and l. s t m is so popular in fact that oftentimes when you're working within our coal or or open source library were a model they wanted recon or n. n. or they will call ricardo my work those call it and l. s t a model or sometimes
the bi directional r. n. n. you deceived by alice t. m. b. i l. s. t. m. it's like the l. s. t. m. is almost the most important piece of the equation as though they just use that to describe the whole architecture are really an alice tim all it does is it replaces the new ron it inside a glove the thin layer of an r. n. n. with a live more complex machinery then was there are to begin with sell an l. p. time series
r. n. n.'s alice t. m.'s you're now an expert you can go forth and make an elk he models there's only one more very popular at neural network architecture to discuss and that is the convolution all neural network them points talk about next episode the resources for this episode the same as the last episode so all just drop 'em in the show notes your fine i'm opposed to val dot com for slashed by casts four slash machine learning

in episode ten we talked about languages inferring works we talk about python our job stalin and we landed on python as the best programming language to use as a machine learning engineer and we talked about all the different machine learning framework specifically people earning frame works compared to each other and landed on cancer flow as the best deep learning framework to use so in this episode we're going to assume that comparison saul that
we're just going to assume we're working with python and ten sir flow as our bread and butter if you didn't listen to an episode in you wanna know why we came to that conclusion go back to episode ten buffer here python is the winner of the languages war and ten sir flows the winner of the deep learning friend works now real quick there has been some changes in the deep learning suffering work space since i last spoke with you namely fiato is dead fiato is officially dead did actually announced
on the mailing list or former something that they're no longer going to be contributing to the project i imagine it's kind of a day if you can beat them join them were the competition's too stiff against cancer flow in world where open-source considers are paid for their work not further open-source contributions so make sense kind of did they get pushed out of the space it's sad that affairs but hey it makes the decision of the learning from works easier for us cafe your calls another combat
gergen the deepening for him works it seems to be a bit dead in the water as well i haven't really heard a whole lot about cafe around hacker news or discussions online these days however to hoard shoot a competitor to ten sir flow has actually been making major splashes recently it's coming up hot on the heels of ten sir flow as a second place contender were a lot people or swearing by torture over ten surf look specifically recall torch which was
previously written all ally has been imported to python and so now is called high torch from what i hear some educators and practitioners think it's a little bit easier to work with intense or flow for the same net gain on jeep you performance all last stuff making him that way and i actually haven't played around with pie torch myself yeah so they'll have to be something you dig into yourself i will still recommend cancer flow or torch merely because to answer flow
substantially more popular than torch which means that there's a higher availability of resources in books learning material jobs employees sporkin's tutorials all those things sometimes it's important to sort of just take the most popular when it comes the framework some libraries in this case to answer flow is still definitely much more popular than pie torch up like torches common strong says just something to keep an eye on that brings us the beginning of this tax that conversation rib
assuming python intense or flow rules again be talking about things like hannah is numb high sai kit learn care ross tanzer force as well as a practical approach to implementing machine learning in architecture where you have made yet how wet that framework communicating with your machinery framer by way of a message cumin sorts before we get into all that let's remember what answer flow does for you you can write machine learning however you want it's just now
medical formulaic which can be expressed in code in python a lot of times when you take a course like the corsair of course for example will actually have you writing these machine knowing equations by hand from scratch in the language that they're teaching an s. fine well but there's two advantages to using a framework one is that these framework to sort of a library of common machine learning functions like convolution all layers of convolution ono met work
rectified linear units and other activation function somalis things but the other more important advantage of using a deep warning for work like to answer flow is that your code get executed on the g. p. you the graphics processing unit not the c. p. u. n. executing your coat on a jeep you can gain you ought to about a thousand acts performance thousand acts as a substantial game informs usually it's not that high usually some more and you
or maybe twenty acts or a hundred acts of something like that and it depends on the task at hand and the amount of marshaling the goes back and forth between your program and the jeep you etc but the amount of performance game that can be hat but executing your machine learning math on a jeep you oversee pew is so substantial that it really gives warrants to using one of the suffering works that does that task for you like to answer flow for those who were for miller
you're with crypto currency mining like mining bit coin or fear him is very similar in that space haven't really powerful jeep you makes using sep you not even worth it often times if you're mining using something like nice hash which allows you to use both your sheep you and your jeep you the difference between the two so substantial that what people just turn their seek you off for mining because it's not even worth the electricity cost that's the k.
you're in deep learned so that's the major benefit that these deep learning framework to bring to bear is that they do all the math on the jeep un specifically the thing that makes how the most is something called auto differentiation it's the execution of both the populists that the back propagation step remember that's the goal earning staff of the machine learning process is called gradient descent gradient descent you're taking a gradient of your
error which is a calculus equations taking ingredient is differentiating grade descendants applies to support that the machine tool logistic regression linear regression when you apply it to new role now works it's called back propagation it's applying grade descends to all of the neurons that propagation is the same as great as sent for neural networks as dawson complications deep down in there where implementing back properties
yourself would not be a very fine task well these fine works automatically take care all of the differentiation phase in other words the back propagation phase by to write evening automatic we'd be calculus equations they have to perform in and performing them which saves a whole lot of effort and a significant amount of time in performance for one reason or other insist on to differentiation specifically that the suffering works tends to tell the most that they dwell on that is like
one of their big benefits i don't know why specifically on a differentiation the great sent part is so significant by comparison to all the other math that these framer to perform on the jeep you is why all the other statistics and money around to perform a wimp but that's the victim in court on notice so pike torch and cancer float execute bodily death for you an automotive happens on the cheap you and not just any g. q. it turns out that and the biaggi p. used specifically are best suited
and to the task and video that land of cheap use the other main branch being amd solicited to common competing graphics cards in the space for gaining people go back and forth on which one's better indeed tends to be more bang for bought the maybe has some compatibility issues and also burns hot and videos older more like an iphone you cannot pay more for the name brands but also has a lot more compatibility with various software the conversation is a law
different in the machine learning space and it is in the gaming space in the machine running space you really do yourself a favor by going and lydia it really is a matter of compatibility and in fact at present tense for flow only supports and idiot so if you could be using the most popular framework out there you're only choices and the the reason for this isn't the improvises sort of proprietary driver set for doing this kind of math on the cheap you that makes writing to this kind of math as a framework to
alper whole lot easier than doing it from scratch and this driver says called kahuna see you da cunha it stands for computer unified that device of architecture and is basically just a parallel computing platform driver set provided by in vienna for framework architects like the developers of cancer flow a comparable alternative for amd would be open c. l. witches and open-source kind of equivalent stick
who wouldn't but which tends to get a lot more second class support by framework architects where two idiots first-class support and on top of today you can download from an via the zipped up folder of deal els called food tiananmen which is a little library of neural network whole purpose to interface with the jeep you and you have to download all screwed up into d. n. n. for your jeep you in order to install ten sir flow with cheap use it
or so i just said something significant said it cancer flow only supports and via jeep use because of this to nothing what that means is unless you have an old man but perot which has none video card a mac computer is not an do for you in machine running world unfortunately my friends i know mac the pros are very popular development machines especially amongst the weather and mobile at developers you can still use to answer floats with
c. p. you support on a map or a matchbook pro by ten sir flow does not support max with jeep you support going forward and i think the main reason for that is that the modern matthews amd so i have switched personally from a matchbook pro to apc i'm a big mac night but i have bit the bullet with machine learning the velma not switch to a pc with a envy at ten a. t. t. i'm graphics car
that's it hobbling graphics card you can get on the market these days for consumer purposes bang for but why is an it's a very very very fast so i built a slight build a custom pc within ten eight yeah graphics card and running at the boon to lenox not windows and not any other flavor of lennox baboon to lenox gets the best first-class support for tense afloat and other machine learning framework schoolwork windows and other flavor
so when experts i recommend a custom built he seized at how or better than the laptop just due to the ventilation issues with its hannay the cia and video graphics card running to boon to lenox that is my recommended hardware stack delegate said you can keep your matchbook growing use to answer flow in c. p. you know if you want to feast on wanted dabble with machine learning algorithms models but if you really want the real deal you know one right on some heavy duty hardware namely of
eric powerful jeep you you could get away with not having that your workstation be the primary heart where'd you run your machine learning models on you could develop in on your math book pro or your windows laptop and you could deploy your machine learning models to the cloud like amazon web services eight of us were google cloud platform g. c. p. or microsoft azure and run your models on their jeep you instances of a very common what is called
p. two topics large instance spike a doubt us any gives you a jeep you you can run your machine running models on running your models macleod it can be quite expensive it's about ninety cents per hour presently to run a p. two x. large instance i get us if you're going to write your models in the cloud i personally would recommend google cloud platform they have faster jeep you instances for less money so faster
for cheaper and they unveiled last year that they're going to be creating server instances which use not a jeep you the something call atp you beat cancer processing unit which is eight should design for running machine learning models specifically graphics processing unit is very good for running machine running models incidentally because it's very good at math but was a bill for that specific purpose t. p. user built specifically by google specifically for running machine learning ma
rolls and specifically for cancer flow and they think they uranium major major performance boost by using cheap use they're not out yet their server kansas is currently don't support tiki use but they do have g. p. use which are more powerful than what you'll find on a dub us or azure are at present being october twenty seventeen and for cheaper than those slower alternatives to boot so i'd recommend g. c. p. over the competition however
i actually personally used a doby us rather than g. c. p. there's two reasons for this one is actually got free credits for dwi swan running my instances for free which is better than she an amazon is famous for doling out these eight of us credit seeking get them from various things in the start up marketplace whether you join an incubator or accelerator program etc see might be able to land some freedom us credits additionally eight of us off
for something called spot instances spot instances what they do is they're basically like an auction up on a price per hour or forty seats you been stands so where are the a. p. two x. large instance the g. p. you sir for instance on easy to costs normally ninety cents per hour a spot instance says how much are you willing to pay per hour okay i'm willing to pay up to ninety cents for example
it may end up costing ten cents an hour or twenty cents an hour it's sort of this price fluctuation and happens to route the day that amazon and if it ever goes all were the max come out i'm willing to pay him then it will just terminate my instance just kill it is needed in the black so this sort of us gareth air is a fear that you may just have your instance hold out from under you as long as you said you were spot instance price high enough then that may never happen and you could end
saving substantial amounts of money i think i average end up paying about ten cents to twenty cents per hour using a spot instance p. two two x. large rather than the standard ninety cents per hour or so i just sat my spot instance max price to ninety cents an hour which is this enterprise never actually gets that high and i never lose my servers and anyway this would be a problem for developing in machine learning models running them in the cloud because usually you'll be
using something like ten am mind that has to answer flow support built into it so spitting up another one of these instances will be no problem on like all web server maybe it needs to have very high availability and reliability so the spot instances line really well to pass machine learning engineers wanting to ryan machine learning models on that sheet for multiple days on a very high and graphics car seat could just use your windows laptop where mac but perot develop him
all locally deployed to the p. two packs large spot instance on eight of us and ron it's fair and then not have to actually switch over to a custom built pc with its heyday eats yeah graphics car running a boon to you could do that but i would recommend still do in the pc route because in the hands unless seagate free eight of us were g. c. p. credits you'll still come out saving money with a custom home bill pc over running amok
loud after maybe six months to a year it's still cheaper to go with a workstation home then with the cloud eventually run in the cloud to deploy your models yak shalala production system and in play though we're just talking about our work stations here celeste the hardware tax that either a custom built pc with unenviable ethics car or if you prefer you can run your models macleod malice talk about the soft for tax act actually we're using sensor flow or to be using him
all the other libraries as well hannah is not high a psychic learned maybe something called salary for a message queuing baby carrots or cancer force will handle is one by one so first off mushy learning works on t. f. you have to have begun to crunch the numbers to build a machine when model to come up with an estimate of something maybe you're coming up with an estimate of housing costs that the linear regression model or of classification that's a logistic regression model
works on numbers in those numbers come from somewhere someday us at your days second either be in a spreadsheet c. yes the work itself file it can be a folder of images if you doing damage classification working come from a database like host grass or my ass too well or maybe and a key i'd like quan dole queue u a n t l a popular financial data set a key i've if the da is given to you you really have control over the situation it's you
sully coming due by way of a spreadsheet c. s. b. file but if you have control over the situation i'll recommend using a full fledged or d. p. m. s. aid to pay slut post grass is that close grass specifically is my favorite or g. b. m. estimate it is very popular monks developers to spend the main data bases in last five jobs i've worked for city get to choose how you're handling you did a story in post grasp if you don't get to choose made it's coming from a p. i'm going directly into your machine learning model was coming from us
right she then you start with what you got whatever the case maybe you're going to be consuming your data from your dataset you can be poignant your program and your python program and the way you would probably do that is by way of candace pandas is a library that's kind of like a spreadsheet in python it's a very interesting little tool first it provides a step for pulling your data from the dataset that dataset may calm from us spreadsheet so
can this has a reed c. is the function or may come from a sequel database like postcards it has a weed seek full function which interfaces with sequel alchemy a popular python or ham or is it coming through in a p. r. a. using requests or what have you you would then just manually right code that types of independence once your d. n. a. is out of your days and independence pandas allows you to what the coal mines de mon jour
clean your date at seoul's for example your dataset may have a lot of knowles in the various cells in various rosen clones arabia bunch of noles and anti value not a zero in all adding nall can substantially scrub your machine learning model before you start doing she learning you might think i'm sure my machinery mole lawrence who ignore the noles right and in a machine running model special is something so complex is a deep bureau mel work learns what height of david this horrible lasso
to murder come to its conclusions no no not so machine learning models and indeed the neural networks are very sensitive tunnels those can really does make smoke and fire come out of the hood and kill the engine say happy do something with those knowles you either sat down to zero but sometimes that doesn't help you very much for example in the case of stock market to death or financial did you how you have prices on a daily basis if for whatever reason you're missing a price
on some day setting the price zero will make it look like the stock market dropped on that date which can totally messed up your machine learning model it's assessing its zero you prefer to forward fill it with bid price the death from yesterday this is called for filling in tennis has a function called a feel for forceful wilson of function called the filter back phil so pena's allows you to fill your knowles sane way
however the case may be freer circumstances the allows you to turn numeric data into categorical day that vial one hot including or vice versa categorical didn't maybe your columns represented the strings turn those into numbers so pandas is all about manipulating your date as to clean it up so that it's ready for your machine learning model hand as is about the amman j. cleaning up your day that they may be thinking what if i'm using a sequel to
it is like pose grass quin nie do that for filling or are coalescing knowles into zero values or are transforming string values into new numerical value solace of can i do sir the data munching as the day it comes in from the database directly so it's all part of the sequel query the answer is yes of course by not everyone's dataset is a sequel database some people stopped this comment from spreadsheets sometimes from deep yeah
is hands as has been the case on recent project of mine i've been bouncing around between different data sets trying to find the perfect date is set to work with while building my model so i'd rather they dated cleaning step exists in that can the slayer and because my dataset mcginnis source may change on a week to week basis so you had your dataset whether it's a spreadsheet or sequel comes into your python code by way of
and those which then cleans up your dailies pianos to clean your data and al your day is clean and ready for your machine learning model what you do is you take it into something called numb hi annie you and p. why number high non pie is all white bird for working on vectors or me to seize the portents ers of any dimension linear algebra basically not high is linear algebra so you would use non pie for trance posing a matron
for converting the matrix were doing and got caught between the tutsis et cetera the recall that's statistics in calculus and when you're out your brothers to the three branches of mathematics use the machine learning and specifically sort of that coat local most of what you're doing is linear algebra and that sort of what nom high provides so you're dedicated firma dataset they got cleaned up by canas and i you convert your date aflame in pay
those two a matrix a matrix of numbers and you're gonna do machine learning math on it so numb pie does that kind of math you could write any machine learning our revenue needs you in them pie the danger of being corsair of course was hot in that lab known pie is very similar to matt labs the language not high sort of gives you the things that python lacks compared to mal lab c. can slice nicer major season to all that stuff so
injure being credible threat of weeks hot course entirely in number high on python rather than that lab but he chose to do on our lab now you may be thinking wait a minute i thought that we want to do all of this math and do when you're out of account the statistics but we wanted events cancer flow on a jeep you yes indeed yes indeed we wanted you dead intend to flow there is a heavy overlap of numb piet with cancer flow so everything i said
about using umpires slice nice you were major season two linear algebra mala staff you don't wanna do an umpire you what you intend to flow because you want to execute on the jeep you alf course sensor flow is a new or framework so the staff didn't exist ten years ago where number idea it can serve was basically bringing them high to the jeep you in addition to all the other deep learning framework utilities like like activation functions and convolution all layers of stuff that cancer flow provides
that is a huge amount of overlap between empire and cancer flow imagine them as of then diagram with aids very large sort of overlapping space a lot of the function calls all of non high with the same and let the message of the same name take same amount of parameters is cetera et intense are full sensor flow try to make the transition from nom high for people who were used to that too tense or float this seamless as possible and in fact it
you're using to answer flow without g. p. you support say you're just doing development on your map up throwing you only have c. p. you support them to answer flow will actually use numb pipe under the hood to execute its math black even if you're using ten sir flow for everything on the jeep you you still have to have known pop a you still have to have our round known high a tends to sort of be the common language spoken by your python program
anticancer flow now umpires sort of marshall's day that between your python program and cancer flow back and forth back and forth with does it wraps your data flames they came out of pandas as a major sees the cold and d. or raise an umpire raise endear raise is basically a matrix is either a bit of actor or a matrix worth three tents or wherever have you some empire wraps these as testers and enhance those oft
spencer flow an intense are full receives a number high matrix and it brings it down to see executed stefan the jeep you and it comes up for the response down here in c. comes back up to python and puts its response into a gnome pie ten sir again and give that back to you so sore this common language that your python program and cancer flow speak so with all that said you can write as much of your machine learning
program in them high instead of cancer flow is you want and you can write as much of it in its hands are full o' instead of an umpire as you want at some points at some point you have to have a little bit sensor flow and at some other point that they have little gnome high so magill like this sliding scale bid to win one in ten we you can slide this scale from the left bingham high into the right being ten souffle could have as much of your machine learning logic in
cancer flow versus non piet as you want ideally you want to write as much as possible of the linear algebra stuffed into cancer flow because that's a big net gain you get from executing your math on a jeep you will find sometimes in some get harbor posit tories some boilerplate code they came from an on line tutorial they're not very rigorous about getting as much as possible into the cancer flow code seal see a whole bunch of sort of custom now meet jai lai
jake that could have actually been handled by tens or flow instead in which results in slorc code execution performance but they don't care in there just put gather a quick tutorial but in the end for your production code you want to use as much ten surf lowest possible so you did it comes out of the dataset wetherbee oppose crusted days for spreadsheet the pipe it into the hand as you used hand those two minds and clean your degas filling knowles with c. rosa war
for filling them from prior entries turning categorical stuff into numbers turning strings and some numbers all accepted clean up your data with pandas you marshal pandas into nom high non pie is the way you represent your data sets or your data flames from pandas as major she's worked for answers you do as a minimal amount of necessary steps on your number higher raise as possible before piping into
to answer flow cancer flourish seizure an umpire ray goes down to see down the stairs you're in you're in the python room you handed to answer flaw package and numb height and di re that's flown up not to said they fully and he turns around with this package you walk salvador goes goes down the stairs to the basement where that see people are c. c. plus plus in your twiddling your phone service anxiously you wanna go down there things are loaded too fast down there people running around like their heads are cut off your budget
he's in bones and steam and then the door closes from the basement fanciful walks up the stairs opens your door hands you a number height india repackage noises and walks away you the python program on rapid you were numb pie or ray and there you have your answer your prediction for a mushy lying productions that that may be a category apply to an image etc can those number high a tense or flow now to answer flow is an odd duck coming from
a traditional programming background if you made yerxa curious with weber mobile active elements or any other sort of python development or anything this away you write code in a procedural manner put away your right hand sir flow code is very strange indeed and the reason is that cancer flow chloe you're right he is an abstraction it's not the real code it's executed because the right hand sir flow is some sort of simplification ads
fraction layer that the cancer flow people provided to you in your python worlds and what happens in the end you write hundred lines of code on the hundredth wine of cohesiveness seal the deal the criminal waiting perhaps awaits all the cool you britain's thus far and sorely prescient jerky when you executed tester full code it sends down to see that hunter flow framework it actually gets ready in a different language and what's get executed it is entirely difference
that of instructions so this is similar to the few familiar from the database background check with object relational map or skoal our campus common one in python being sequel alchemy what you write this python code using this abstraction layer is the key i but we finally executed the code would you run a boar and got execute or have you would actually get executed a sequel eskew elko naturally and
or am rats sable coat it's a very simple thing i mean what happens is your python code is translated to sequel code in python it's so simple in fact the lot people issue the use of or n.'s what people don't like using more and they say the heights you from sequel in sequel isn't easy language anyway you might as well gain the flexibility in power of knowing and writing sequel directly rather than hiding away from yourself with in or around
that's fine well with your rounds is not fine and well with computation graf frame works like cancer flow and high torch because they perform that guano differentiation and other sorts of math on the jeep you say you have to write yourself see you wanna use these things is similar concept you write your coat and python we're doing is you're constructing what's called a computation graphic photograph of no it's so every line of cancer flow code is like you're us
i mean a graph know the circle some sort of operations call one o'clock opie to a variable and then a subsequent wives of code kollek these variables and combine them in some sort of way whether they're doing matrix multiplication or piping them through or rectified linear unit etc combining combining to mining until the very last line of code sort of is the last combination it's the thing that has connects the whole graf together and you execute
it passes that often tense or flow framework which sort of rewrites the whole thing and see it wholly different sequence of operations in executes the thing on the jeep you in order for us all for work the way the cool cool looks when you write it into cancer flow is really odd it's really awkward dealing with things called fetches and feed it gets in variables and place holders and initially it seems very awkward n.
on intuitive but actually it's a it's a hump yet to get over there is a definite learning curve to writing cancer flow code that the peace that you'll actually get over that learning curve at the pre fast i think it took me about a month of writing to answer flow code before i got over that haunt the first month was like what the heck am i looking at and then month to month three right okay things is smooth sailing you really understand how worst is similar to our china one functional program and it's it's horribly difference
i know of code but once you get used to it and inmates lot of sense in a case of functional coding delia skeletal never go back now that's ten sir flow brought spencer flow yo con awkward for right because it has a sort of encapsulate should paradigm will wear what you're actually reading is a computation grafted then gets passed on down through the framework there is a framework howled fair that eases the burden of this process that makes writing cancer plough code all i easier lot less awkward that feel
a lot more like writing traditional procedural python is called care ross katie or gate s. is becoming a lot more popular these days care ross is or wrapper on top of cancer flow so you just answer float under the hood but it basically reduces the whole point of cancer flow boilerplate into substantially fewer lines of code in care of us so something that would take you fifty lines of cancer flow coach right a lot of pain
fusion you would write in care austen maybe five to ten lines of code instead and which would look a lot more elegant care ross used to be wrapper on top of fianna in all that did the writers of kara sir very happy that they decided sue fully support answer flow with the recent news of fianna as death because now they're still writing detail coats of a popular machine learned framework and care austin's the very popular with books
spans tutorial code basically where an author is trying to convey how you might go about writing some machine learning code conceptually under less interested in the coat or tax specifics because it care alzheimer's u. from all those oddly details when i see common in practice these people we use care ross has that sort of widow who strapped school or actually there is a c. s. s. framework in wet development called whoosh
rap and i think is a very good analogy to see us as framer called bush trap that allows you to make the website is automatically designed so like every age you know element you put on your website automatically has this theme to its that's very pretty this very basic and very common you'll spot up bootstrap website mile way black at least it's not sort of black on white sort of the melody came out you give us the matter that box at c. s. s. theme c.
you can sort of proof of concept you were wet that you can try your web out out see if it sticks see he'll get any customers and if you do if you're wet that proves itself out you can then take away the boot strap fima and now you can start custom designing your own c. s. s. to give your website a custom designed in a custom look and feel i think care ross is very similar to this way you can do with kara s. is you can write your machine
earning program again carrots first because it'll save you a lot of headache balls with confusion and scheerer lines of code and once you've proved out your model and you've decided that this is a useful route to go you actually want to build this project then you may pull out kind of chunks of care os where you preferred have more flexibility by diving down to the rocks hands are full of the game that terrace gives you any
the city youths you lose inflexibility it's a very natural tradeoff so we can do is start with care awesome sort of start hauling cure us out and going with rocks cancer flow as you need to sort of customize your model with higher flexibility this is a common use case i see so the net when i highly recommend investigating care ross so there you have to answer flow and additionally and optional rapper cold care arts to ease the burden in other calm
and library all see use is called sai kit learn psych yet learned is a library of shallow learning algorithms cancer float is a framework of deep warning algorithms cancer float actually sort has as high or low level as you want to go in that sort of people earning stack it has built into it neural networks out of the box and work for neural networks just out of a box you can kind of like ten long
in the work for neural network or you can build and spencer flow from scratch using linear algebra and statistics formulaic you can handcrafted and neural network c. can go as low or high in abstraction in ten sir flow as you want but it doesn't have functions for shallow learning so has functions for deep learning for constructing deep neural networks whether their work for neural networks are convolution ono met works or mole tyler
perception ons or ongoing colors etc it has all the deep mourning tools built and but it doesn't have shallow learning tools now all linear and logistic regression specifically you can hand code intense sure flow pretty easily there's plenty of other scholl learning our burdens that we've covered that you couldn't easily do intend to flow things like support back to machines naive baze decision trees ran of
arrests etc is so pure gonna be using shao learning for your task that you probably know what used psychic war sai kit learned is that spencer flow of shallow learning center flow for people earning secular and for shallow and the two libraries have very very little overlap so you'll be using one or the other depending on the task at hand now if you are using to answer flow and steep learning you still may benefit from psych hitler and having it
one hand it has a few miscellaneous utilities actually come in handy no matter what you're doing median machine learning for example one thing it has is the library of dataset speaking just hold a data finnair so for example common dataset is the amnesty hand written number is the image dataset and asked them and i asked he actually don't call me on that but i believe it's been a secular combine know for a fact that at guy you are
sunflower dataset which is a very common example is in sight get learned any basically just like imports iris from sites it learn dot data sets back and it's that easy to just whole idea set out of thin air six are developing a shimmering moll without hath no worry about that step another thing that psychic learned provides that is useful no matter what you're doing is date as standardization and normalization sold in machine learning models the learning
stat of greatness and we're back propagation learning step works all i better way and the features or normalized or standardized is a cell difference between normalization and standardization which i will going to hear the edges if you're trying to figure out a cost of a house based on its number of bedrooms it's number of bath terms of square footage is doesn't sound town all these things all the number of bathrooms ninety two
the defense to downtown might be like five thousand whenever a speeches i don't know yet ended just for the difference between those two numbers is either on wholly different scale search wholly different types of numbers and that that's gay old difference can thwart gradient descent and so feature standardization is the process of bringing those suits numbers into the same ballpark and all end up being some number that you don't actually rapid
the number of bathrooms mighty point five and a distance about town might be point seven the point is that it brings them all to the same playing field and there is a function psyche alarm for stealing and normalizing data sets which is something you'll use and people earning as well seeking keep psychic learn round just four of the day dead standardization step that you'll then use you are standardized a debt to feed into tents or flow now that sounds like
actually the job for him that's right hand is all about the amman jean de at cleaned the of preparation well actually i don't know of pandas has a function for standardization are more mobilization and expand as is meant to be more general purpose not you specifically in machine learning onwards is standardization way that tends to be a little bit machine learning center so that might be why it exists in secular or lease is more commonly used for on site of learning
in their repositories that i've seen so that's your tax act you have to dataset be it host grass or spreadsheet or what have you coming in to hannah is being minute marshaled through an umpire it into tends to float tester float execute your coat on the jeep you brings it back up puts in cinema plank is it that you in your python program you make optional we use sai kit learned to standardize your day at warp hole data sets out of thin
eric etc now let's talk about something that is not machine learning center but i imagine will be useful for a lot of the listeners here and that is the general kind of architecture idea for urged a company how you might fit the machine learning server or pinch your system architecture the most companies sort of bread and butter is aware that acts are further their website were their mobile act you're facing with their customers buy me
the website ramallah and so are their main server is their web server their aft sir were you call it an act serb hands technically this is going to be the very front thing for your machine learning server which usually called your job sir are so you're packed server is taking requests from web clients people browsing the web site on chrome or are there by phone or using the mobile app on android these are all your clients
and all sending requests to your webster or your acts are a new web server might be written in no j. s or go something that has very strong current currency support for handling multiple requests for example i actually personally disliked python as a wet act server language even flask in janko the traditional for an acute and python i think things like no jessen go have stronger can currency support for handling multiple quiet
so i personally like no j. s. for writing my web servers and you run this may be on a dub us either bees stock were easy to something with an auto scalar set up again this could be a totally different servers in your machine earnings for so now over here you have your machine running for it's called your job sir are and this is no rhonda on a different type of server one that has a jeep you were multiple jeep use eighty two x. large instance if you're using a debbie west for jay
ample one reason you wanna be's to be two separate servers is that eighty two packs large instance has very few see pews very limited ram been a very powerful jeep u. n. is very expensive okay it and that one's well the machine learning where is a whack at server wants more see views once more ram and doesn't care at all about jeep use and because it doesn't care about cheap use you can cobble law
it costs see you want them to actually be on physically different architectures for want one to save costs and too because the architectures make different sense in different situations to lose you want them to scale differently you know why you're wet that's sure to steal up and down pretty fast and pre sizable chunks where's your machine learning sir or may not scale ever or maybe wanted to new instances here and there on a scale back down to one okay so if these are
to separates servers how they communicate very common way to communicate between your way at that server are accurate in your job sir or is by something called message queuing software very popular message queuing southward called rabbit and q. and another one this paupers called zero and hugo c. n. queue for message que in the names of these software's now you may be thinking well could i just send like a simple west request from my ass
sure to my job sir to do some machine running task yes you could but there are a lot of benefits for using a world last pieces software like the message queuing service if your job server is temporarily offline then it wouldn't have received a request sends by your tap server and vice versa and as a result that message gets lost in tune no man's land gets lost forever say for example you're let's pretend
we're building pandora the user or songs ops songs or thumbs down nussbaum from an app oro website that their clients that requested cents to the acts or the weather for the web server may put that action in the database just keep them on hands a very good is in response down a korean saying i have received your request here's your new song but such them to that new sonnets are playing it worries that accurate as stream the music to a client all let stuff in the meantime
i'm the act server sort of busy dealing with this customer talking to the customer with this communication turns around sort of like a jobs or with videos hand was mouth payout this person didn't like the song can you think that it's your machine learning thingy the job sir reflect got such cordial way on the g. p. u. z. intense are full of afterward as knowing about that okay good medicine scientist over there he goes all the crazy stuff if they catch server could turn round and tried as a job serb and jobs
or were sleeping aka offline job sir would never have gotten that request so switching to a message queuing system white rabbit and you will happen is the acts or will take a request one-on-one bloke says this user didn't like the song go to a mailbox and put it in the mailbox and close the mailbox and come back and communicate with client whatever envied jobs server is ready to do machine learning stuff
wherever it's done with some tax cuts currently on or it comes back on line from being offline maybe a crash for something or just wakes up in a yawn isn't it looks a good time makes its coffee and then it goes out the door and goes to the mailbox and picks up the requests close the mailbox and goes back and it does it's machine learning stuff with their requests an additional benefit to this is if you have multiple jobs jurors multiple machine learning servers running cancer flow
they're jeep use one of them will go and pick up a message on the mailbox and handle it and that message no longer exists in the mailbox so by the time the second job server comes around it will either get an anti jobs you or the next job in line so you robust these socks were like brad and que makes for more false tolerance reliable sensible handling of message passing between an act and a job server a common
piece of software for a message queuing up in python is called salary salary abstracts various message queuing software like zero m que rabbit and hue and more than our way you can just use salary and not care about what message queuing software your system architects have decided upon under the hood or switch to a different message queuing service as the case may be salary lastly and i've got a little
bonus software package to talk about a framework called to conserve force tense air force is like to hear ross for reinforcement wanting so we haven't talked about reinforcement warning much yet but reinforce the learning it is awesome it's a burgeoning space in machinery for all of the best and coolest research is happening right now reinforcement learning it is where are the machine learning be calms artificial intelligence in fact reinforcement learning
equals artificial intelligence so for those of you who've come to the space of machine learning it because of an interest in a high well what you should be to harding is or will reinforce them i guess we should have your goals set on a job eventually in our l. will talk about reinforcement learning in subsequent episodes reinforcement learning is a very different beast then supervise learning an unsupervised learning for one that deep reinforcement warning it is a much
new we're states and if it's much less explored the reinforcement learning is the stuff you see coming out from the mines and open ai playing video games playing go driving cars all these things and recalled reinforcement learning is action based machine i think so supervise learning it is coming up with a production based on past day yes so predicting the category of an image are predicting the sentiment of the sentence etc reinforcement lorne
his action basis deciding what action to take on earth situation that's why when as well to self driving quarter deciding whether to turn left at the time right et cetera and it's very research center crying now not very developer friendly on like supervise learning which is very developer friendly by way of cancer flow and care rocks supervise learning it is developer friendly because supervise learning has a lot of common that developer apple case
and skin industry in standard of professional settings where is reinforcement learning does not quite how that yet so this is really more lines were better to research than it does to industry deep reinforcement learning and as a result trying to implement your own deep reinforcement learning algorithms means you have to like get to read these papers you have to relieve can craft bees hyper parameters to it she is not all our resources out there yeah
for practical implications of deep reinforcement learning our rooms except for ten sir forced tens air force is a framework which makes deep reinforcement warning accessible to working along with him recently and combine that can recommend an cancer for subject that are right big label lands we talked about your workstation ideally being a custom built tower pc with a high-end ten abt i've been geographic scarred alternately you can duval
your models on a computer you want and run them in a cloud eight of us should g. c. p. i recommend g. c. p. we talked about auto differing works high torched cancer flow fiato in cafe keep an eye on high torch used to answer flow pandas numbed high and psychic learn our free libraries if you're going to use in addition to cancer flow in your machine learning tool belt tennis is for retrieving and cleaning dana no
hi is sort of the common language of nature's season cancers spoken by your python program and you're tense your flow code and sai kit learned is bowl thirty library of utilities that you may find useful no matter what you do and the framework of shallow learning algorithms if your task is a shallow learning task as far as system architecture goes you'll likely have an answer or the w. wet stuff and the job server that does all the erma she learning
stuff you why your job sir of course to have a high-end g. p. you you'll communicate between the two by way of the message kulik rabbit and fuel and there is a rapper library in python called salary which makes working with message to southward easier speaking of rapper libraries making things easier care ross sits on top of ten sir flow to make ten sir flow code more palatable it boils cancer flow down into fewer lines of code
makes it look more like a traditional procedural programming at the cost of less flexibility to answer force is a rapper library on top of cancer flow for deep reinforcement learning specifically because reinforcement learning sort of a different piece then unsupervised and supervise machine learning resources for this episode or are the usual keep learning resources which all postma shone out and a book that i have recommended the past is called hey
hands-on machine learning with psychic learn intense are full of actually just finish this book and this is my favorite machine winning book i've ever read the fact my favorite machine lying resource i've ever consumed except for that andrew being corsair course that's a solid gold and pedestal that you can't touch and shooting for sarah's course always comes first but this book is phenomenal it's actually very applicable to this episode specifically it talks about secular an intensive what talk about hannah is unknown pie
a and dataset slight databases and spreadsheets everything that i've covered in this episode is covered in this book and the author does an excellent job of explaining things i've found that there is a dearth of well explain to machine learning concepts in the industry which is why i've made this pod casson first place i think the sings don't have to be so complicated they can be boiled down really well and this author action is a very good job of boiling the scenes that he makes mush
she learning called runs very understandable he talks about shall learning he talks about id gone so close that in the show notes usual place boasted of eldar comp or were slashed broadcasts forward slash machine learning by the way if you're interested in purchasing a workstation pc to run your machine learning models on i would recommend going with a custom built tower pc building yourself don't go laptop unless you really need that mobility because neil lot more performance with
desktop p. c. and don't you were those prefab desktop p. c. is like cyber powerpc for example there are great company and have great computers or a constant sheen learning you really wanna milk every last time you will drop out of your purchase never the same price you can get on the order of maybe fifty percent back sure a performance for running him she learned models by custom building which can mean the difference between training for three days versus today's so on my website i'm going to post a perch list
of the bill that i used for my computer and i'm going to try to keep this part was up to date with state of the art components as new components release so that no matter when you listen to the spot cast you can go that parts listen bill your own p. c. for example this is october twenty seventeen the techniques yeah graphics card and i seven series intel seek user topple line but very soon or kennedy getting into release of intel c. pews and volta graphics cards from ten video which should be a lot
faster all optical it's when he's released all also posed a link to a video series tutorial on how to build your own p. c. also speaking of performance and this is our random aside when you start really get to the metal with your machine learning development the old cancer flow from source you can milk all lot more performance out of tens full bill from source then through the pit installation it's kind of a pain in the buy so start with that when you first get set up and don't worry bout
ling from source until you're really cooking with fire with your machine learning models what you really start getting deeper new development you gil lot more performance by building tanzer flow from source doing it that way also allows you to use the latest code out and to d. n. n. releases with a stable releases of cancer flow tend to be on very cold versions of good and true d. n. n. n. newer versions of today to milk substantial performance improvements off see you in the next episode i don't know when that will be again i'm not on a schedule
any more the next episode will either be on a convolution own neural networks for image recognition or neural network parks like bavaria's activation functions batch normalization various optimize years like adam and stuff like that so i'm not sure which of those episodes and i do next that aussie when i see you also a new job


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash m. l. g. eight and i'm also starting a new contacts which could use your support and it's called last year's like taxes and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode twenty five convolution o'neill now works today we're already talking about consonants convolution all
neural networks for c. n. n.'s before we do that little bit of that man i've been told by a handful listeners that they wanted donates the show except that patron charges monthly and they only want to donate wants to have created one time hey pal joey been as well as posting might get coin wallet address for you crypto junkies if anybody is willing to donate to the show if you not willing to donate please do we will review on itunes that brings more listeners to the show which helps keep
so why then well soaked convolution all neural networks for one reason or another consonants tend to be the most popular topics discussed by new aspiring machine learning engineers i don't know why specifically kong snaps are so popular manner stand that vision is essential to key components to robots in ai in all our stuff but no less so with the natural in which pricing by waiver colonel met works in the like but anyway connoisseur super popular in the deep learning space calm
gnats or this thing of vision in machine learning in the same way that rucker neural networks are the things of an elk he'd matalin was causing as well as any sort of time series problems of the stock markets and whether production compliments or four images image classification image recognition computer vision and cons next to me were real clear case of the machine learning hostile takeover of artificial intelligence asset this entire episode i think that
crux of ai is an al that m. l. is fast simpson ming ai a significant way so much so that the terms you're almost becoming synonymous that's definitely the case with an elk he machine running came in maine ahead began to wither colonel my works on all the various aspects of an l. p. s not to say that an l. p. was entirely conquered by machine learning that the machine learning has contributed very heavily suspects in the case of computer vision i think we see that even more so
oh consonants really truly dominate the space of computer vision and so already talk about that today with respect to this classification image recognition alike now for those of us good memory and you recall from a prior episode now stock about facial recognition know is using a malt highly your perception on right of the nail in your own mel work in an l. p. as an example of an algorithm for image recognition i said that first thin layer might be for detecting things like lions n. a.
just a second hand where for shapes and objects and the third inlay or four things like eyes ears mouth and nose and in the final we're being the signori function if you just concerned with protecting whether or not is facing a picture or a soft max if we're trying to classify history dog catcher human so is using in an l. p. for example image classification i lied to you my dear listeners nobody uses m. l. p.'s for him is classification the use condom
it's been an elk he sort of one's well to a pedagogical mental picture of the situation and we encounter m. l. p.'s earlier on our machine learning learning so i thought it made sense to give you a picture though you don't use them out he's for images use continents and yours why and an help ye for image recognition is like using up bag of words for spam detection that he may be thinking hey i thought you said bag of words algorithms like naive days
work well for stan classification does take all the words in an e-mail and you just come on just for all my bag you shake up the bag and still out on the table and case of span attention in nashua line which processing maybe you're looking for the word by agra cage cup pushing all words around all there is by agra bam this is spam easy pc yes better worth works fantastically for natural language processing in certain problems but using a bag of words kind of idea at the end in its classification
doesn't make sense what you would be doing is cutting the picture out into all of its pixels katie have a five by five picture you have twenty five pixels and then you throw all those pixels into a bag you shake it up any doubt the pixels on the table and now what howling at the supposed to detect whether or not there something that you're looking for in that picture is just up bag of pixels that's when an elk he would be giving you an m. l. p. you remember the other work for a regular new roman were
and dna anna's another word for it the bureau my word for nikki and an artificial know my organs can be calling in and out he's now on an m. l. p. consists of dense layers dense layers meaning that's all over the neons from the prior where are connected to the next layer so all of the pixels of the input or connected to the first thin layer all the pixels or connected to every neural first in layer so everything is combined with everything else and in all the
as neurons are connected to all of the neurons of the next ten where everything is combined with everything else it really is like a bag of orgies growing all the pixels and combining and every which possible way but that's not how pictures work when you're looking for something specific in a picture you generally looking for that type of object we julie located in one little window one square with say that we're looking for waldo already using where's waldo is the example of this episode we're looking for waldo
a picture that is not an ideal little piece of waldo in the left and a tiny piece of wall on the bottom right and maybe he's happened center the picture and his foot over here on the top right as not now works is already clumps together in one object and that object can be anywhere in the picture so that's why i am l. p.'s to work for him is classification instead we wanna neural network that works with hatchets windows of pixels all it wants lilt shrunk stay in the picture
can't even within one window in a picture window that may be up walks around waldo in the picture you within that window we still don't wanna just combined every pixel now window every which way with each other that still will be very helpful for detecting whether waldo is in this window instead we really wanna look for specific shape or specific sort color pattern in this window and so what we're going to design is something called off filter
all filter is the crux of continents it's the core components water filter is is an object detector imagine that you have a five by five piece of paper and you take scissors and you caught out the shape of waldo in that piece of paper so that there's a hole in the center of the peace paper this is shape of walled up at any take that these paper can you put it on top of your picture you're fifty by fifty image and i you take that piece of paper your filter
an easier thing or two slighted to write the slide it all were the picture you slide it from the top left all which the rights and you bring it down one roll star back on the left arm with a typewriter rate hike will win the right in good answer the peacekeeper goes up to start the next line at the left many start sliding your filter to the right again in the moment they years actually all waldo in the picture will be very apparent you because still sort of fill in that hideout in the center of your piece of paper
up until that point until you are piece of paper was over a wall though nothing sort of obviously fields that hole in the peace paper that was cut out with shape waller nothing very apparently filled it with all this the bonds of sort of pixel j. bridge until you got overall waldo beneath it just so perfectly right into that cut out and it made him papa made him really stand out says not really an object it's hector there is no activation function or output of this new
on that gives you a yes or no necessarily instead of the thing that sort of makes the object hot makes it stand out in the location where he it's so that's what a filter is it's almost like a separate damage the smaller image may be a five by five filter that you're going to be using to search for an object in a fifty by fifty image and the filter is designed in a way that makes what it is you're looking for hot makes it pop out of the picture now having your filth
we're sort of be the shape of waldo is a bit of an over simplification of filter usually doesn't work that way the filter is usually ill little bit more simplistic them that in case of walder detection for example one actual filter we might use is going to the horizontal stripes because wallace shirt has already horizontal stripes on it so simple filter that would make him hop out of the image is a filter that has these stripes on it or is on all eight though i mean by
that is it's a five by five phil certified by five sort picture square of pixels where every even role is filled with winds and every claude row is filled with zeroes basket of like the cutouts but that does is when it is applied it to a patch in the picture all of the even rows of that patch or disabled because they're multiplied by zero all the pixels multiplied by zero and all of the audit rose above that patch
or enabled because there are multiplied by one and so when we hover over all waldo will see a bunch of red stripes pop out on us were hovering over anything else in the picture is for looks like straight nonsense soul filter can learn something quite so complex as both come out of a human shape but it can learn something simple enough they could still give us a good inside us while we're looking at and then we would combine multiple filters together to really
increase our confidence so waldo has glasses he has ever be yes red striped shirt annie something about being call is very skinny guy kind of a occupies berkeley a very small section in the center of the window so you might imagine designing four or five different filters each of which is looking for different patterns in the patch of pixels and all of them combined sort of making something pop out a picture that will give us confidence as to whether or not whirl
looking at an object we're looking for so let's put these altogether in we'll call abortion o'neill now worked for us why say up to pixels but this is called is a window or window is a square ciampi in the picture and as filter is a filter again we have a filter or any number of filters that we're going to be starting in the top left of our picture and sliding to the right and any time is sort of hovers over something that we're looking for that thing that pops out through the filters
and makes it stand out in the image why think about filters ally to imagine them is kind of like an old school n.'s sort of a cylinder a big hole in between your fingers and you know you can be put on the picture the top left you look through it with your pie closure other i knew looking through the lens with your eyes and you're sliding into the right and most of the time or you see is sort of borer go whenever you are all over the thing you're looking for in the picture then it becomes very clear of the waldo
comes very clear where is the other windows of sort of blurry now inside of that cylinder insider that lands there are multiple filters the maggi go to an eye doctor he put someone's isn't from in your eyes you're looking at some letters and he says better or worse he puts in a dish in all arab lands isn't for your eyes he's a better and he keeps that bear and he puts an additional layer of lenses in front of your eyes a third lands and from the other two aces better or worse in you say works so he's trying to fly
ainsworth this right sequence of layers of lenses that really makes the latter day on the board hop out you be very crystal clear enough so you're doing in designing these filters to couple lenses cylinder object that has multiple layers of filters inside of it and this is what the machine learning models going to learn it's going to learn the design of each of these filters each filter ole are in your sort of cylindrical lands now we have the filth
or that that is not actually daily or we're talking about deep learning here neural networks we can design ole are hidden layer in our neural network is that we have a little too cool enough tool belt this lanza soldier in order to come shocked the first hidden layer of our convolution o'neill now work with cold the convolution ole or what we're going to do is like essay we start the top left with this filter and we apply it to the picture all the way to the right we slide
all with the right and then like typewriter church in we started the next role on the west and slide it all went right again chechens are the natural flood all the way all right again until we've covered the entire picture that flag this filter throughout the picture and while we have now is a new picture in entirely new image where are all full wall those in the damage ha all wall those are now crystal clear and everything in between is borer
the orchard were she picks fully this is called a feature a map of feature matt filter is that cool we use for making an object hop in a picture in a feature mac is that picture schranz formed with the filter in every window every one square although picture is transformed with filter in now we have a new image is called feature map now like i said this land is that we're using to slide over the picture has more
couple filters inside of it multiple layers of filters each soldier trying to detect the different type of pattern straits classes shapes some the whole thing in the center of the filter etc multiple layers of filters and so what is output in a bar called lucia layer that next layer is actually multiple feature max one feature map with each filter apply to the picture so while we have in our first hidden layer of our neuro now
work is a fair read the box of pixels and free the box of pixels with by height ok this same with an heights as our ritual picture except that instead of being picture it's our filter all flights to the picture for every window for every patch of pixels in the image with by heights and then depth death is the number of filters so each convolution ole or he is
they with by height feature map feature matt being applying one filter to your entire image and death being the number of filters you have okay kind of confusing so let's start from the top we have a picture that comes in is your input into d. with by height we don't fly may know what our neural network is going to learn is filters filters are these masks that make certain patterns in a pixel patch be we
no hop hop out of that window this is what the convolution o'neill networks can all learn the soldiers nor have multiple of them we have one filter for stripes one filter for glasses shapes one filter for skinny object in the center of window arrest after these on top of each other were to take that stack of filters were we to apply it from left to right top to bottom in our picture and that's going to i'll put a new picture with by height pixels but it
death is the amount of filters so what we have a box now that's our first inlay or or convolution all layer away or of feature maps if we want additional him layers of our neural now work we would do this again we'll learn a new filters you'll play those new filters to that first hidden layer because at first in my ears kind of a picture of its own it may not be a picture that makes lot of sense to humans bill makes sense to the machine learning algorithm we will learn these new
altars and rule plied them window by window by window to that first thin layer and what will get out of it isn't new picture a new convolution all air which is with by hike pixels and feature maps depth the third dimension being feature maps the future map is when you apply your filter to every window of the picture and that will be your second in later years second convolution all layer and then finally to sort of cap off your convolution all neural network what
we usually do is then hide the result of all that through dense layers you've made certain patterns new picture pop and stand out in now you can sort of latch on to those with your dance layers to determine whether something is in your image or not by piping after a soft master logistic function of the white very good that is a convolution o'neill now work for a talk about the additional details like shrine in padding window sizes and max pointed it out is why
you know that's the essence of convolution ono met works each layer is called accomplish all air will lay your ideas is a stack of feature maps in the feature maps calm fromm applying to filter across your picture as c. soldiers the wheeler filters that the continent learns in the back propagation stand now oftentimes indeed learning part of the process is sort of boy ewing things down step by step as we go through the neural net
we're spread this looks like a final every layer of neurons gets smaller and smaller and smaller until our final output is either one you're on the case of logistic regression or one of multiple neurons but i mean let's say ten or twenty in a case of soft max regression if we would have liked all layer of five hundred and twelve neurons and the next layers five twelve in the next layers five twelve sort actually boiling things down we're just kind of mix and match in an the last layers that once a maury
function right well first off that final error would have way too much work to do we would be depending on it's too much to sort of boiled down to see you reverse of combined features into one point we would be all for working this new onto would be better afflicted boylan down bit by bit by bit until finally it was last neurons tang he only has maybe twenty eight employees after reports him but in addition to that part of the magic of neural networks is that a great things down
hierarchical it so that they get smaller us maurice ago long soak in a picture for example if you start with a fifty by fifty picture about would be twenty five hundred pixels twenty five hundred units in your input layer and ideally you would boil mac down into let's say ten or twenty different types of wines and objects and then you would boil that down into eyes ears mouth and nose for objects at any boy let down to one says cut away the deep learning general
work's not always but generally we like to go from very very big to very small gradually hierarchical a novel way i've been describing convolution all ayers is that each feature map is the same size as the picture of their plight to we take our filter we move it window by window over the picture what comes out as a feature the exact same size if we have multiple convolution all layers like this that it doesn't feel like we're sort of boiling our picture down to its essence
over time the way we do this way we boil images down into their essence step by step is by a combination of window size stride and having a keg window strident and had a no win no we already talked about window is the size of a patch of pixels that you're looking at anyone given time in your picture so a window of five by five means you're looking at twenty five pixels awards stride is how much you move
that window polls are at a time if we had a strike of one we would move that window over one pixel at a time meaning that will filter matt sat to the future matt can accomplish all air girl bill lot of overlap between each window if we had a strike of five that would mean the window would skip completely to the next package sir filter look of five by five window and then it would slide over five pixels all the way past the last
axles seen them in the first observation so the filter is now looking at a new patch with no overlap with the prior patch of how do we reason about this stride and window size combined your speak about them in combination try to think of them is some sort of ratio like to over five five being the window size into being stride size or or something like this window in stride always be considered together in the previous example where the pictured it smacks directly to a feature man
and at the same dimensions that case tried over one if we were to use a shrine of five why that would do is take your windows your five by five windows and boil them down into one pixel each so you take a five by five window and now we turn into one pixel in the downstream feature map if ye strike of one huge slide right one and that would turn into one pixel as well in the downstream feature matt essentially we look to
to pixels in our original image and has become too pixels in our new image in our feature map so that didn't actually do any sort of compression it just did transformation if we wanted to compress the image into a smaller feature map that bigger shrine of five when you do is you take a window of five by five that would become one pixel in the feature match any move over five whole pixels and that new five by five window would be calm and new pixel
feature map and everything in between would be left out so all the pixels will have been considered because we can study pixels but bill has been boiled down substantially twenty five pixels will be calm want that's how you do short of compression in this process you have a higher stride and higher window sides belt that's not always beneficial let's say for example that waldo sort of straddled in between those two windows we have we're
no fly by five and then we strive five so that we know now moves to an entirely new set of pixels all right in the middle there half his body is on the right side of the first window and the other half his body's own westside second window neither filters would pick up waldo in the windows okay we've got the strike detector filter maybe that would ding ding ding bull what about that sort of skinny object in the center of the window filter that filters knock him
eight anything pop in the window so even though a higher stride will give us good sort of compression work boiling down of our windows it may result in for detection of objects so going middle ground is generally preferred may be ascribed to rest right of free so there's always a decent amount of overlap to see waldo because at some point you will be in the center of it a window hands because the strike is greater than wine these windows of five by five
we'll still be boiled down into smaller patches in the downstream feature met so some combination of window size and stride is how you achieve boiling things down into smaller layers elect s. and windows fred bayliss go hand in hand it's a real wild understand continents because they're so many tom for talk about filters and feature maps call lucia layers windows dried padding in max polling these are all terms were not talk about the sabbath
and so many terms it helps when you realize that many of these terms or combined with each other they're different pieces of the same thing so window in stride bayliss go hand in hand feature map and filter are basically the same thing filter is a small section you little paper cut out of five by five sizable window when you apply it to a whole image you give feature sophie sure matt is up quite a filter to feature map of filter they go hand in hand all yours
teacher mats stacked is accomplish all we're so all those three things going and feature mathilde for calm was aware of it at all here we have window in stride dosing sky go hand in hand for the image compression then the other thing that goes along with him is compression some may call patting the padding is very simple to understand padding as we have our five by five window and sliding into the right okay let's say architecture is not fifty by fifty but fifty two by fifty to some number this not divisible by five well
wendell slight although it's the right until it gets those sort of last two pixels know we can decide one of two things to do we can either stop there and moved to the next row or we can move up our window five pixels so right anyway there's only two pixels left in the picture soul will do is will create three fake pixels they basically zeroes so that the remaining two pixels or considered the sort of know what part of our window and end
access is deceased big pixels and presumably because now wall learned that this access on the right side of the picture can be ignored we call patting it this same honey coles same when we include the fake pixels and we call a valid when we exclude the access pixels i'll have a great way for remembering same versus ballot iowa's have to look about personally so they just two separate ways of handling that access pixels they might think say
amen to that is stink always including the access pixels seems like this more weight always goal should we always include every pixel well not necessarily a lot of pictures serve the borders of the damage are kind of croft me we do cropping as a pre processing step anyway many times so in many cases that schooling the small amount of borer pixels is not a big loss in other cases you do want include ever
a single pixel especially in cases where it's not actually the image recognition we're working with i will talk and the subsequent episode about how you can use convolution all neural networks for stock markets stock market prices are not looking at an image whatsoever to wholly different space and computer vision continents and work for neural networks you can use these sayings sorrows in very surprising domain c. patch think outside the box but in those cases where you're working with features that
really pixels one include all those features not processed and so having equals same is the right way to go to just depends on her situation okay so we talked about window in stride and to some extent having those freed being used as sort of an image compression technique always of boiling down your picture at one layer into a smaller convolution all layer and in doing same thing second lucia where to next call bushel layer and so i
is smaller and smaller and smaller than you paid your debts layers you're working with a small matter features which are about that as one way of doing image compression and that's compression in the machine learning cents it's compressing features into a smaller feature servile represents all the other features is hierarchical a boiling information down into smaller and smaller bits there's another method of image compression in convolution romeo my work called max pooling and this is sort of a trigger
chill sense of image compression which is simply making an image small or not actually doing a sort of machine learning to stealing it down glossy compression in the truest sense max pooling or there are other types of pulling layers we call him pulling where's you can use max pooling or you can use mean pooling celeste talk about max pulling because that's the most common when max pulling does it takes her picture and just makes it smaller that is it just compresses it down now it's different then
using a complex called blue schull error of filters and strident patting him blah blah all it does is thus arab oil in two by two window into one pixel of tissue dividing about for you making every patch of four pixels become one pixel to just down stealing it substantially all you're doing is you're taking that patch of four pixels that window of four pixels in your taking the masks pixel that hit the maximum pixel by that i mean it in a grace k.
oh the image every pixel is represented by a number between zero and one where one is black and zeroes white so we take the maximum of those pixels and we just use that in throwaway the other pixels this is just true compression this is compressing images like if you're trying to off load a photo to facebook and said your pictures to bagel you tried oppler picture that's ten twenty four by ten twenty four and pretended facebook says we only except images one twenty eight by one twenty eight k they don't do that kind
russian on their side they expect you to have smaller images to upload to their website well what you might do is open up reviewer for shoppers something and just click and a picture dimensions and just make it smaller that's all it's going on with max poll is she's making a picture smaller is doing so in a very destructive way you know from experience we make pictures smaller or bigger it's law see if you make it smaller it's glossy compression let's cut tax laid in silence of the old slow but off about the peace corps your eyes you can to
all that there was some damage down the process we have to swing your eyes nasty idea here with max polling is you can apply glossy compression tier pictures to make them smaller without doing too much damage in the process now why would you wanna do this we had the option of using a big stride and big window in accomplish all layer for boiling a picture down for boiling the essence down rush throwing stuff away were boiling it down to its essence why would we wanted
as max polling we use mac schooling for eight wholly different reason that reason is this save compute time it turns out that convolution all neural networks are the most expensive neural networks in all lands more than work hard neural networks more than an l. p.'s more than anything why will we take an image that has with by heights and accountable supplying those two stars number of features is concerns and your pie
being that into a convolution all layer that has with by height as well as death is sometimes very very deep that maybe sixty four feature maps or ninety six feature maps and you might have ten twenty hidden convolution all layers when you start looking at the image net competition a kong met architectures these things are massive this is really where you see your jeep you shine if you're working with an m. l.
he wore our colonel mal work you know we'll probably see it five to ten x. performance gain by using your jeep you instead of your seat you when you're using consonants you'll see it your jeep utilization spike up to ninety nine percent and you will be screening fast running your calls next on your jeep you by comparison to seek you combine our taxes is really where your jeep you performance shines and not just the computational speed
either the amount of memory it's used by your architecture or ten eight cia for example has about levin gigs of ram separate from your systems ram well when you're too old legends crosses inure to be consuming all lot of that ram so continental heavy very heavy beasts and easiest ways to a slim them down to make them less heavy is just image compression just make your image is smaller and that's what max polling is for using a combination of straw
i ate it and windows size to boil york images down it is something of an machine learning technique that's boiling down the essence contained in the pixels of your image of mac schooling is just for making things smaller so that no run faster and you can apply max pulling up to your image directly right after the first where you can also quiet after every convolution all air because each convolution ole or will they may be coming smaller in width and height their problem
we becoming deeper in debt of feature maps to using max polling will reduce the dimension ali of your process making your continent run faster by the way there something i forgot to mention earlier in this episode we think of the convolution all areas with by height by death k. with an eye pixels and that's being feature maps well liane put layer image also has depth is orgy be red green blue valley we call us channels so
we your input image is with by height pixels and channels deep everyone pixel will have three channels being or g. b. values to your input picture is also a box and every subsequent convolution layers of box so really every layer is kind of a picture in its own rights okay and that's it that's convolution romeo math works they're not easy but they're not complex i'd say architecturally he does have to reach
actor on them and you know maybe ought to read it twice to come to grips with what all the moving parts are here but unlike something like natural language processing where maybe understanding our work her neural network works is fine and dandy but i understand label land of an l. p. there's been a whole lot of problems you have to solve with continents the one prominent salim year is the image recognition or object detection image says not a whole why you have to know this isn't a three part series like with an l. p. that just
make sure you understand all the parts i'm sorry i'm so redundant rest are for the top and work our way here you start with the damage is a whipped by hate pixels image incidentally is also three channels deep this orgy devalued see that box battered image you heights that into your compliments your first hidden layer is called a convolution all air and away the slayer functions gets these convolution all layer has with by height pixels as well
and feature maps depth any number of feature maps deep these feature maps are derived by applying the filter one filter her feature map you look up like this filter to the image but talk left corner of the image you slide it to the right and it generates sort of a new image where are the objects that that filter is designed to make pop well it's a new image were poll
all those objects in the image pop soak in a waldo detecting filter your feature map is going to be on new version of your original picture where everything is blurry except all wall those who are very clear sir you're filter is some small window of pixels that has something sort cut out of it and you apply to your whole image when you get out is a feature matt you do that with every filter in your calm lucia where you
a new work feature maps of the convolution ole are each call in show where is with by height pixels and feature maps deep is the filters that your neural network is trying to learn you specify out fried actually the amount of filters you're going to be using with him out of feature maps in your convolution always be specify the width and height of your convolution aware as well as the amount of feature matt's being used to the death is the job the neural network to learn the designer
a filter is not the amount of them so that's the essence of it the details are the filter has a window size of the size of the filter is called blue window with and heightening beautify by five that is so small square the stride determines how much that window moves at any given time if you're using a strike of one that window moves over one pixel of the time and the resulting future matt is the same size as your rage all the image
if you were striking is five then your window moves over an entire window at a time so that there's no pixel overlap and each window of five pixels becomes one pixel in the feature map in other words your image gets compressed to a smaller image generally a good strategy is to use something in between maybe a window five by five minutes' drive to so the salam out of overlap
to prove the likelihood of detecting objects and yet some amount of skipping which results in the damage compression additionally a technical detail is what you should do when you slid your window all way to the right and there's access pixels do you include them or do you spit them if he skipped them we call is valid padding and if you include them we call this same padding and away we make that work is by adding an extra down the pixels c.
roll pixels so that our window of five will fit all over five pixels some of which are gonna be donny pixels combination of both window size padding and stride will result in image compression in each convolution ole or until your final air which is generally a good strategy but another way to achieve image compression is called max pooling max polling it is la si simple image compression used to cry mare
early to save system resources if you're images are too big or your convolution all ears are too big and it's just hurting your grandma or your jeep you performance you we use max polling okay so that's the general architecture book on wish multnomah at work that's the general architecture now you probably won't have a great deal of success trying to freelance your way through designing a continents understanding the gym
earl principles how to design accomplish all arabs and then building an image detector with that they'll probably give you kneel the decent image detector maybe ten percent error rate wharf twenty percent error rate it turns out that's the amount of accomplish all layers and where you put the max polling layers senate and the window size and stride size in all those things these are the hyper parameters right selecting these things are choosing your hyper parameters calm that
hyper parameter selection is very sensitive is forced error rate is concerned he was very very well tuned compliments then you're gonna spend an hello lot of time to your hyper parameters a soul one thing you can do instead an especially if the image detector buildings is a classic type of image detector you're actually trying to detect people and dogs and in common objects in common photos is use one of these off the shelf called
at architectures so there's this competition call by el paso v. or see image next challenge and it's a challenge for people to be aloof set specific objects in a bad day basis photos and a whole this every year every year people come to this competition and they peaked last year's continental architecture with the new architecture and new combination of max polling and stride and window and number of
your maps and although states and so one of the classic what is called laying next five is in yon looked whom that elegy for liqun and a subsequent year's winner was call alex next so that would have beaten lane that would decrease the error rate and then a subsequent one is google maps and then the next one is in section and then next one is raz nets and so on and so on you may have heard of these different net architectures i heard these things flown around so long
time resin an alex net and realize that they're all com that's been none of them are or immense none of them are penalty is so we hear something that's you're probably dealing with a continent in these kong nancy's architectures are enormous there are some big big contracts very complex and very sensitively tuned hyper parameters so if he just won the game is detector for some project to join the robot with vision you can use wannabes off the shelf networks
i could roll thumb is just use the winner from the most recent year used point seventeens winner for example it will have defeated all the prior architectures but if what you're building is in the domain of computer vision but is maybe a little bit less common than common object detection in common pictures than what you can do is sort of steady the architectures and see what makes good hyper planners and good layer style
and then use that to drive design your own confidante so i described you in this episode is the core components of designing a con man architecture the very likely if you actually plan on using continents in wild specially for image recognition you'll want to look at one of these prefab architectures they came out of the image that challenge and probably use the most recent winner cool cool that's it for this episode in the resources that
and i'm going to post linked to the u. to record a series of c. s. to thirty one and of course by stanford specifically on continents and of course the standard deep learning resources i've always been recommending all pulses no-show notes in the hands on the machine learning with secular intense are full of books that i've been recommending has a very good chapter on combat says well boss elan accept so


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you

loosen up project that we use a community can develop together sluggish sharper cheetham she learning engineering the project is going to be a bit coin trading box does a few reasons for the selection of this project what is the crypto currency is a super hot topic right now another is that a u. unreliability rich for this project i'm not getting your country harnessing the last six months nights and weekends and cross my fingers it'll work out someday will build a crack go to the main reason for using bit coin training for our project is that it's going to lead
really well to the coming episodes the next episode after this one's gonna be on paper parameter selection and one after that we're finally give us our own reinforcement learning deep reinforce her wedding and the grain trading handles very special we in hyper parameter selection this next coming episode in theory intuitively highlights lot of the decisions that we can make about choosing network architecture which types of layers to use whether they're ellis t. m. or convolution all layers activation function
as with all the layers and things like this it more intuitively highlights these choices than many other scenarios in machine running do it the coin trading is very special and that makes these types of decisions of high printers very intuitive will see that next episode slow hard to understand right now another thing that makes bit coin trading special as a machine morning project is it's flexibility training can be successfully donna she morning either by unsupervised learning shoe
why is learning and reinforcement learning all three branches of machine learning you can apply to trading and you'll see in this episode that trading is a very simple concept sister surprising enough flexibility we have in the types of machinery paradigms we apply to the scenario see start to see this quite special another bit as you can use convolution o'neal lal works or elle est yeah i'm rick karr neural met works in your network architectures freer trading model which is very unusual pickling training is will see
the sexes a time series scenario the intuitive networked architectures and l. s t m work for no man or when you're not restricted seizing that in fact many people had more success spinning the situation as accomplish on your network scenario such training is a very unique scenario that one's welsh will lot of machine learning concept exploration and which will dovetail us eventually into deep reinforcement learning so to the project in it's own right i think it's something know what the devil get
gavin hey maybe we can make money off of but importantly for this contest is going to fit very nicely into the progression of episodes from here on out of this episode is going to describe trading day trading swing trading at is going to describe crypto currency and bit coin in all that stuff if you know about crypto currency if you yourself for a day trader skip this episode there's no machine learning in this episode we're not quite as sets of contents were machine when framework in the next episode
so few no crypto any no trading status episode but if you don't feel like you know both or either of those will not listen to this episode because a lot of the details are in a comment on explains in future episodes so this'll give us the ground work okay before we talk about treating we're gonna talk about crypto currency smudged two aspects to our project crypto currency and crypto trading now crypto currency and not so sure i need to really introduce i imagine most of my listeners
carved well acquainted with it's a super hot topic right now everyone's talking about bit coin our parents are asking us how to get involved in bit coin all that stuff but i didn't choose between nonetheless for diligence and they will talk about trading bit coin is it's height of crypto currency or just quit dealt some people call it a crypt joe currency is a currency just like the u. s. dollar is a currency the european euro is a currency the japanese yen except it's a universal currency right
and being paid to any specific country that the crypto currency is it said digital currency that's completely managed and generated the giuliani and crypto currency is not managed by any one person organization or group is managed distributed to all my years in the network in may for this thing bit coin mining or basically people have their computer riggs senate usually up the fiji pew senate very similar to a machine morning pc actually whether doing is they're right
a bunch of equations calculations coal mining it's basically handling the infrastructure of the currencies existence processing transactions with the currency making sure new bit coins are released into the world in a proper time we weigh in the same way that the federal reserve candles distribution of the u. s. dollar so's to strip and with a big network of people ends all transactions purchased with crypto currencies our report on today's shredded ledger
home run record celestial of information you've never heard of kurt occurred to them either the whirlwind the crux of it is the crypto currency is a currency just like the u. s. dollar except that it's management is super secure super permanent and completely democratize completely managed and owned by people it's a very special thing indeed it's been a lot of publicity these days for very good reason it offers a lot of value into the financial market place in office lot of competition
his value over banks and over governmental overseeing of country currencies say to you may have heard this thing people say old crypto currency is a big ball because there's nothing backing it on like gold which has a physical object backing it was not true with backing crypto currency is the value that that's high security in on temporal and permanent histories transactions is called ledger and democratic management all things the real currencies laughed so the something's up stay
so backing crypto currencies that coin is one of many crypto precedes the coin would be like the u. s. dollar for example there are many other critter currency is what's called a fury among others call like coin and others called rebel they all have symbols bit coin is b. t. c. just like the u. s. dollars u. s. d. the syrians the t. h. all the coins the most popular because it was the first of the crypto currencies it was the flagship of the concept of crypto currency built on this
underlying technology called block chain all those benefits i'd mentioned previously about distributed permit ledger security blah blah blah that's all built into the technology called block chain and on top of watching we have crippled currencies and one of those could occur in seizes bit coin and dick when was the first and therefore is the most popular is not necessarily the best differ crypto currencies have different sort of steel billy profiles and additional features so for example if you're in has this thing call
the smart contracts which actually like you sign a contract digitally with somebody and then based on some of them to execute that contract with your contractor working for a company you might use the fury him to sign and executed contract and i are locked into a contract if you decide to break that contract whether you leave the company earlier do something like that that penalty can be enforced program at levi that contract is so the combination of smart contracts that should permit ledger and always
things baby does lot opportunity uses technology to reduce legal costs an investigation mitigation the government uses to automate taxes at the end of the year and all that stuff crippled currencies were really cool stuff all our relish for potential of future with this technology now we're interested for our purposes as a trading vehicle day trading swing trading discuss that he might've heard before we could trade stocks and bonds and for encouraged
he's in any of these other things that people have traditionally been trading on wall street the last many many decades we could do that that there little bit complicated get into getting into trading stocks can be quite a technical her old getting started you also have to sort of keep your ion which stocks you want to trade sell stocks and bonds us out that manual too complicated for project for us one thing we could trade is foreign exchange for ex f. bowl
or he asks for its james is very similar to crypto currency country currencies crypto currencies are very similar you can trade country currencies on a four exchange in the same way you can trade cooked up currencies on an exchange like g. dax which will get to it that foreign currencies go up and go down the ad and flow just like stocks to slip ons certain countries economies might be booming like china for example fast case maybe you should buy some chinese
red sea in exchange for your u. s. dollar if the chinese economy is burgeoning more than the u. s. economy and presumably you'd be making money on that purchased the value of the chinese currency the u. just purchased increases and at some point you can decide to sell that to your u s dollars back in exchange for the currency you own annual have made a profit because you sold after the value had increased so we could trade in foreign currency board and doing crypto currency is digital curry
see because of the twirling that's available the exchanges out there like g. jackson cracking have fantastic keep yeah it's very nature crypto currency being this new generation digital phenomenon means it has all the great digital tooling around it that makes working with it as an engineer very easy so the main reason we're in the trading in crypto currency compared to traditional instruments is just convenience by the way that we're instrument
is sherman refers to anything that you can trade so okay stock is an instrument a specific stocks so the apple stock is an instrument facebook stock is an instrument of foreign currency is an instrument the specific bond is an instrument equation instrument okay so we described crypto currency bit coin is the main crypto currency out there just by popularity were therefore going to be using a coin instead of your am rebel likely center just because it is more historical day
now available for bit coin all exchanges support a quaint etc bella stockholder more about treating this two words to be aware of investing and trading when you invest you buy an instrument or some amount of some instruments white stock in apple for example because you will leave in that insurance you believe that the value of apple is going to increase in the future investing it is putting money where your belief it's an any just leave
it does leave your money there the stock market goes up and it comes down and it goes up and calms down is like this ought to third graf can you ignore the graph you don't care about prices in the short term because all you care about is in the long term generally speaking if your theory is correct your investments value will increase trading is different traders believe that's the activity on that craft does indeed matter the idea goes like this in you may have heard of this phrase
buy low sell high let's say you buy ten dollars of stock in and then over some of time it doubles in value now your stock annapolis worth twenty dollars you bought ten it became twenty now let's say that apples value is starting to creep down wolf you jump out just in time you sell your stocks the u. own x. twenty dollars and less a apple stock crashes back down to ten dollars all what does happen you don't hold your vow
you put in ten came out with twenty you pablo use old high so the idea of trading is to look for these patterns in the graft and in what's called price actions of an instrument you look for these patterns can you buy any soule based on the patterns so that you can come away with more money than you put in the catch phrases by low and sell high but it's usually not that simple and the prom with that phrase really is how do you know what slowing was high how do you
no when you're at ole ole or if it's gonna keep going lower and how do you know when you're at a high or if it's gimmicky going higher so investors and traders are are fundamentally different people investors believe in the value of something they put their money in that stock or in that bit coin and they just leave it they close their eyes big deal would be stressed out by that wild graf they know that in ten years' time the walk away with more money than they put in traders on the other hand buy and sell based on patterns
the grass on a daily basis on a weekly basis on a monthly basis however much amount of treating you want to do if you do all of your training in the course of the day if you're just glued to the screen and you're buying selling and buying selling the colonnade day trader an important bit about a day trader is at the end of the day trader closes his or her positions in other words he takes all money out and put in his pocket as what his value to fluctuate overnight when he can
you're watching it so he manages all manually all the course of one day goes to sleep wakes up and starts over again generally a day trader at such a full time job there's lots of day traitors out there that that's all they do many of them a whole lot of money a day trader is probably what you have in mind when you think about stock markets about trading on wall street woeful walsh reconnaissance these guys in business suits glued to a screen black screen with green and read it fry
this chart so in numbers and his two grams on their monitor any other hold the the tickets in the air and they've got the visor something like that's the old style stock exchange trading now are things digitized course gasoline trading is anything outside of the tree gave you don't close your positions at the end of the day in and go to sleep with peace of mind if you continue to trade of the course of days or weeks or so minutes call swing trading they're very similar it's just bad day trading towns
the more back full-time person will work to build together six needed project is a swing schrader effective way because it can do trading overnight if you're so inclined but anyway it's gonna be a machine learning automated schrager it's gonna buy and sell based on patterns are recognizes in these graphs the chairs work on patterns in the graphs is the pattern is there a machine learning to take it up there for we should have machine learning be are automated day trader for ourselves
the weekend go to our full time job make extra money over there now can you buy a bit coin first place we go to these exchanges so called exchanges if you were to buy stocks you go to a stock exchange fury buy bonds you go to a bond exchange against him by foreign currency you go to a foreign exchange for x. and if you wanna buy bit coin you go to a crypt deluxe change to very popular exchange is what is called g. dax g. d. day x. subsidiary of aqaba
he called coin base and others called crack in there is no company in charge of the coin or any other crypto currency for that matter exchanges are basically just like bank accounts wells fargo and bank of america don't own the u. s. dollar other places where you can go in store your u. s. dollar crypto exchanges are places where you can go exchange or u. s. dollars for some amount bit coin now you hold some bit coin on an exchange and you can trade back
forth between your dollar and your bit coin t. x. is probably the most popular out there so that's what i recommend you using if you're in the u. s. crack in is a little less popular but it's also available to european citizens and others know what you're doing is still going she'd x. dot com daniel sign up any open the budget security information and you put in your bank wiring information than any transfer money from your bank into g. x. and now you'll have a certain amount of money in u. s. dollars in g. that
so now you can trade those u. s. dollars for bit coin what you'll see in front of you the black screen and some charts and some history grams is numbers a whole bunch little stuff is in these charts that you'll usually spot the patterns that as a day trader you act on the bill look at the screen is your terminal and based on activity in these charts you're going to decide whether to buy a coin or to sell bit coin or to hold still do anything by cell
all syria looking for patterns in the charts were these patterns come from become from what's called price actions they can imagine that the value that coin goes up and down up and down and age ross's long-range heart well was say we want to make the machine learning model around that would you do well you have to crime stats every times that you have a price the price of the queen at that time the price of the coin changes depending on how many people are buying or selling bit coin the value of the coin is and how many people
of purchased a coin more people by bit coin more valuable what is sick imagine all white shark and every time step is a price is so if you wanted to build a machine learning model here when you might do is use in ballast yam whitford neural network and are an end to remember is the neural network best design for tying series d. s and equate price histories indeed time series day at with one inputs that every time step being the pipes
let's say it's ten thousand dollars at times that one and it is ten thousand and two dollars at times that too in ten thousand three dollars at times that three and so on you my bullet alice t. m. r. n. n. where you hide in the history of some tiny slice let's say a hundred and fifty steps in the label the thing you're trying to protect us supervised learning scenario is the next price that you label so you can put all the time steps one to one fifty a new
training your model to be able to protect the very next time step times the hundred fifty one in this case better supervise learning situation bing bang boom we have a day trader easy easy that would be with the most basic way that you could envision this project and alice tim are then we feed in we few notes five steps one the input court finds that that's the price in your training it to predict the last times that betraying a tube
it's one time stepped into the future so if your training it to be a day trader you would predict one seconds into the future in our example where every time set is the second but then you as a developer would have to heart coded the rules on what to do next well if it predicts that the price is gonna go pop in the next train step wall baby we should make it by if it predicts that the price is going to go down again
next time step we should make it sell by low sell high right hands if the next price production is the same as the current price they should hold it should do nothing very good we have a supervise learning ellis t. m. o. r. n. n. model that will take him all the prices as strange stepson output the next time step production and then we have some custom code to decide what to do next physical problems here the first one is
it's not that simple with buy low sell high it may seem so at first but it really isn't this a lot of clever strategy is for working the system like you're playing chess the trading isn't that simple job in fact many people steady day after day after day training in sandbox environments and lose a lot of money in their early years is a traitor until we're really start to get the system right so it's really not so simple to buy low sell
either starched shirts and strategies is so that we just one of the reasons why we're discussing bit coin training as a pedagogical machine learning sneer you won first place which is that the problem can be posed either as a unsupervised learning situation i actually don't know how you do that but i've heard them before they supervise learning situation which i just described in which case you would have to program by hands the next step actions or a
reinforcement learning situation reinforcement learning takes to supervise learning to the next that reinforce hillary has incited it's package like it's stomach imagine this robot with an alice t. m. r. n. n. in it's stomach it has inside it's packaged supervise learning incentive package that has the capacity to estimate the next time step based on prior historical data and then in the outer shell
of reinforcement wearing the model learns to act he learns to take the correct action they can learn very sophisticated action sequences of actions and strategies and so forth so this is the situation in which we do you supervise learning for treating bought or to use reinforce the learning for treating bought in a car project the actual code is when to use the reinforcement working by way of a framework called cancer force i think ray
for swearing is a much better fit for automated trading unsupervised learning bubbles can be it's sour the first bomb was how we envision modeling our situation was that it may be old predict the next time step to some degree of accuracy using else tia marta and by that doesn't tell you what to do next and it's not as symbols by low so high after all so switching to a reinforcement learning model could mitigate that issue the second problem is that a single price
at a time step is usually not enough information to really build a pattern matching model is very unlikely to build a palace to him or a man that he really accurately predict next step prices just based on price alone one input is really insufficient for any machine running model so how can we get more inputs out of our situation more inputs for every time step was yours how at any given time any
number of trades could be occurring on an exchange any number of other people could be buying and selling bit coin to in other words high aim is infinitely divisible as far as treating is concerned the sounds confusing one china say is you're gonna have to decide how to partition you're trying steps or maybe maybe once every second once every two seconds once every minute every hour every day well if you decide
on the part fishing your time steps into one second bob gets well with him that one second slice of time and infinite amount of trades may have occurred now a high frequency trading algorithm they're called h. f. c high frequency trade these things will split time again to milliseconds nanoseconds in that case these algorithms could capture every single individual chew
rate they call you supporters the capture every single order on the order book as a high frequency training our room and there's no chance in hell our project is going to be old to catch every nanosecond slice of time so we're gonna take it out scale war is say maybe at twenty second buckets of time every twenty seconds renege go out to g. dax is a pianist and asking for informations on the trades that occurred during that time now what happens with air
retreat every time somebody buys the coin the valley goes out every time somebody cells bit coin value goes down in other words during the twenty second slice it time to the value of the coin has gone up and down up and down without us and many saatchi's graf within our little slice of time so what can we do maybe we can average all the prices but coin has been attacked during that chunk of time we could take the meaning of prices have something we can do it's job
really not recommended one downside to that is that outlier prices came very strongly affect the means and this may occur in a situation call pump and dump somebody on the exchange who may be has a billion dollars to their name for example they can put 'em million dollars into the coin they can buy a home million dollars worth of a coin on g. dax now the price has skyrocketed the value of that coin is now very high will buy
just traders may see this spike in price and they may think that we're entering a bottle and all very hurriedly say bye-bye bye ronnie aquanaut is so everybody will put all their money into the coin as well in our prices even more op and that initial person who put the million dollars in will now hold the million dollars out because the value has increased and he's selling in high it's a very deep move indeed but it is very common and very strongly effect
is that price averaging because the juices and out why are they can really mess up your clobber them to mess up humans to to avoid taking them enough prices in a train slice instead what we're gonna do is we're in a collectible inch information about that time slides were asked yet when i entered this time slice we enter this twenty second interval what was the price then that was the old tin price open price and what i accepted this time slice whoa
the price that was called a close open and close the all of this twenty second time slice was the highest price pick one ever reached that's called a high for example or million dollars scenario million dollars of the high level with global was the lowest bit coin sonnets times twice that's the law or logan high low close o. k. h. l. c. this method is sickening the prices was invented by the japanese they call the candlestick park
calling him but it worked fine slice they call it a candlestick the really going kill sake is at the convention it's like a box plot from statistics we have a vertical are the body and it has whiskers on top and amado the top whiskers behind the bottom whiskers below the conaway out wires in a box plot well the japanese invasion those as we explore channel and the body of the candlestick topple either be the open and close and
bottom will be the opposite depending on whether our candlestick is going up or going down by comparison to the prior candlestick if our current candlestick is going up if the price has increased in this plane sliced by comparison to the prior time slice them the bottom is the open and it's hot is the close of the body of the candlestick and the color of the candlestick is green you know 'cause it's good collar beams were going up
and if we're going down then that hop is the open and the bottom is the clothes and the color is red 'cause we're going down so that's a candlestick okay chelsea open high low close there's one more important number in that trunk time it's called volume how much was treated during this time so for example the fact that that jerk spent a million dollars pumping the price but only one per
and did that means that there will be low volume when the price is high the volume is low that's a good indicator that we got company temper but if the price is high and the volume is high that means many people are buying into the coin during this time slice during this candlestick and that's a good indicator that it actually is going up so open high low clothes and volume always shall see the those of a five no
i'm results seem very very commonly if you look on an exchange terminal the price actions the actual lying raffle price you realize is not actually allying graf it's a budget candlesticks those cables it'll be colored red and green depending on if we're going out we're going down and ohio whiskers on top and bottom and those are your open high low close numbers then below that the price graft you'll have a fist a gram of bars by correspond
it's every time step and those are your volume numbers so we start off with a price grappling graf him we had a problem that and that only a game of swine input for retired slice than we realize way out way out there's no such thing as a tougher in slices infinitely divisible and so we had actually decide how much of a graph we wanna split that so we can say split everyone second or every two seconds for every three seconds
the high frequency training auburn soulful it every nanosecond or sell or not that computational intensive sorus whatever one or two seconds well in so doing we just introduced to ourselves five new numbers that we use as inputs instead of the one that allowed us to get morgan puts out of that price graf bowl h. l. c. b. or candlesticks son are trading model start a little bit more sophisticated week we can envision it doesn't tell us
am i or n. n. that takes in five inputs every time step and either outputs the next price production or we can use reinforcement learning in that hideaway from us and it will just decide whether to buy sell or hold there's a few more input sweetie juice out of those candlesticks by the way we call these indicators in this constant cons of indicators out there very common was called the simple moving average and the idea is that looks back in time acts
some amount of time steps whenever you want say two hundred times steps or fifty times that's you specify the window and it comes up with a moving average hence the name which is the number indicating it generally it's sort of the direction of the graph of the price graf if it's positive there were growing up if it's native that we're going down it is very positive then we're going very far outfits very negative there were going very far down you get the idea is simple moving average or ass and a another one is called
exponential moving average another one is called up or pacifier or relish straight index another one is very bibles called the whacked volume weighted average price and there's a whole one to mothers buzzer probably the most popular specially for starters but i just listened but there's many many indicators and basically you could try to ease into your model as additional inputs if you want now because these indicators are some rising price history
scotch case could be made that says we're using in l. s. t. m. worker neural network which already sort of aggregates history over time they may be unnecessary is something that you'll wanna experiment on your own wife are right we have price actions that candlestick daily chelsea feel that i will close volume as fight features right then and i did every time step we gotcha we have in eighty years which aggregates time stamps prices they come up with additional members
maybe valuable for your model no one final input we could juice out of our price grass is this is called risk of arbitrage is very valuable risk arbitrage the r. p. i n. t. e. r. a g. e. it's very strange word arbitrage canadian goes like this she jack's dot com is probably the most popular crypto exchange in america i'd say spanning the english speaking countries and general
will focus on g. x. and crack and crack in the little less popular than she acted spans more than just the united states the european and u. k. countries can use that exchange but is less popular west popular than she backs of yours why that's important is a phenomenon and finance called the efficient market hypothesis in the idea those that the price of any instrument stock or bonds is exactly what should be the price of a measurement is what should be it's fair
are they caught in other words the price of the coin that like eleven thousand dollars what is today is exactly what should be should be eleven thousand dollars now the idea of what it should be quote unquote is that for the large numbers of people who are involved on the exchange on gee that's all large amount of people are involved in doing what's called fundamental analysis the researching the value of the coin in watching the news keeping i am only other car
seizes cetera fundamental analysis is c x yet chewing your research on a company on the stock on a crypt of currency any instruments doing your research called fundamental analysis and deciding to buy and sell based on that kind of the investor friend she well what's so many people performing fundamental analysis and so many high frequency training algorithms performing technical analysis of what we've been spreading in this episode stadium following charts following numbers and patterns between those
to the fundamental analysts and tactical analysts the price of a coin is going to sort of start to waver teens the middle of what it should be the actual value of the coin the actual value of a bit coin to humanity you know eleven thousand dollars a day according to the efficient market hypothesis is the real value the bit coin holds to humankind's the salon beef with the efficient market hypothesis day traders obviously contend with a
in this whole thing where if that should get made sure it sufficient after the analysts have done their job but the analysts can still be a faraway doing their job that and making some money a process blah blah blah but the point is in order for the efficient market hypothesis for work out is you have to how long it would set play had to have a lot of people leveling out the price was more people on g. x. and less people on crack it now let's say that she acts is price for it
coin is eleven thousand dollars in crack ins is ten thousand dollars different prices and it's actually occurs a lot more people and she acts less people want crack in the fish market hypothesis is driven by numbers that means g. x. is more correct then crack it's that means by in crack in because it's going to correct itself the gun of trying to get the price up to the real price spiegel
one thousand dollars that's an oversimplification there's no conscious effort in this process on the crack in exchange with people trading over there is sort of like this just natural equilibrium that occurs on financial changes so that's another input we can hide in that any kind step is all of the holy chelsea b. plus indicators coming from g. x. pipe that end but also the same day that firm
crack in tight bowl fix changes price actions and indicators in at the same time and it could help him all decide whether to buy on crack in 'cause it might catch up to g. x. sprees like half call so that's it for trading in crypto currency now i've already started the code for this project is six months old line of it's actually pretty close to working it's using the brave for smuggling by way of tension force with actually convoys
no no corks not else to him or an ensign will discuss the reasoning for that next episode at all postal linked to this open-source project on my website boasted of the law calm for slashed by cast for slash she learning so next time will discuss paper parameter selection for models in them will finally get to be reinforced for learning the cool stuff artificial intelligence r. n. c. in exam


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you
episodes details and eaux c develop dot com forward slash n. algae it time also starting a new contacts which could use your support and it's called last year's like tax and teaches conductivity focused tips and tricks some which could prove beneficial in your machine learning education jury finds that atlas c develop dot com forward slash l. l. h. this is episode twenty seven hyper parameters par won today already talked about hyper parameters
this could be a two part episode got a little bit longer than i thought i would bless every n. or hyper parameters was talked about hyper planners before by comparison to parameters to review the human decides on planners are the numbers that machine learning model learns is learning process so in linear logistic regression your fate of parameters are these waits in front of coefficients to these numbers that model learns parameters are the bit that the machine learning all words
hyper parameters are any sort of knobs and dials the u. as the human are in control of so there's some obvious cases of hyper parameter selection for example with regular station that will talk about the next episode selection of dole won l. two and dropouts both the numerical values that you can assigned to this realization terms or even than your use of those regulars asian parameters that cyber selection is something the u. is a human shoes in neural network are
it's capture the number of neons in any layer and a number of players over hyper parameters for something a huge shoes hyper primers are they really mean anything human chooses so let's get a little bit less intuitive the selection of what type of model to use in a machine learning scenario three guineas linear regression logistic regression the guineas naive days or neural my work that's hyper parameter it doesn't seem like a hyper brammer first glance but really any sort of do
seizure in the u. is the human can make that affects the machine learning model that the hyper parameter is really only a useful characteristic when you can compare the selection of hyper parameters so like i said you could choose linear regression model or you can shoes and neural network that selection raiders hyper parameter is a useful hyper perimeter because you can compare the performance using cross elevation of linear regression to the neural network they're not apples and oranges
the result was a numerical score representing the realm of performance of one versus the other now really talking about a lot of theories hyper parameters nice two episodes things like neural network architecture but activation functions nonlinear he's regular is station parameters stick have steak grievous and optimize years like that a grad and adam things like feature stealing in bash normalization stuff like this this episode is gonna be some of the more high level parts things like neural network architecture
seizure of what types of ways to use like alice timber says cnn layers and unacceptable be smaller bits like regular is a chanel one al toon drop out but don't let that big versus small part fool you every single hyper parameter can be vital to the success of all miles training as an anecdote in the bit coin trading bought project that we're working on together i have personally found that the combination of no-one else you and drop
look here regulars asian currency you can use one or two or three of them and whichever one's you used to have some numerical value i found those rigors asian terms to be more vital to the success of the deep reinforcement learning agents they and the selection of the agent hype that will talk about reinforce learning episode things like proximate cause the optimization versus de que network elbows or huge that the difference between a pee pee owner deeds un as a huge difference but found
the combination reposition terms how strong are the facts on the outlet to every hyper premier counts in what a constant shooting hyper parameters every punishing learning moll has a handful had rumors that goes along with it so neural network for example you can choose it's wet it's depth the types of layers whether they be ellis deal where's convoy years or dance lawyers tell what else you in dropout regulars asian a handful of other hyper parameters but most
ever parameters have the same d. fall that you can start with so for example no-one else you they tend to be in the point zero zero one weighing somewhere around there tends to be a sweet spot for many researchers just getting started so you do is you start with the same d. faults let's say apel won all to set point zero zero one met death at one or two met with two let's say a neuron something like this and then from there after you've selected you're saying d.
faults of hyper parameters then you search for better hyper premier combinations to use something called grid search or random search which all described the next episode or more learning oriented approach colby xena optimization which uses the scene statistics to actually hone in on better and better hyper premier combinations overtime tesla high level stuff ever parameters are knobs to use the human turn don't
shirk the turning of the snobs because it is vital to the success of your model screening process in the way you go about this is you use all the fault out a box and from there you use grid search random searcher be seen optimization to get better and better and better accommodations over time now when i first found out about hyper parameters by comparison to parameters that looks kind of ugly i was kind of surprised about the gold machine morning was to learn everything i thought a machine going models the postal
our nuts and bolts especially was some talk about am i thought that ai supposed to be super self sufficient what we use humans have to turn these dials non citizens seem very magical seen the buzz kill to me in fact it seems like there's more hyper parameters then there are parameters can anyone machine learning motto is a human does more than a mile creek on magical to me was the deal here well you and i are not the only people thinking this removing hyper parameters from the equator
it has been a long standing goal of the machine learning community right now we sort of how linux boxes we have to compile everything from scratching you have to add your own packages with certain flags space center seek you architecture and all the stuff very complicated and very hands-on the goal we wanna get to eventually some ask you just for a man comes a box you open up and it's good to go but it's just not that easy you see this is the goal of researchers is to sit sit
i'm the hyper parameters into the machine learning models that'd be calm parameters of them she learning model can learn everything for master bolts this is difficult and it will take time but it's something that we have been accomplishing with every machine running breakthrough so for example the sooner the neural network the neural network introduced to very powerful breakthroughs to the machine running community one was the ability to represent any complex situation the caller
the universal function approximate are theoretically the neural network if done properly can basically do anything with any uses theoretically you could use in your own outward for everything forget the support vector machine forget logistic regression forget the selection of any model under the sun and just using neural network know like that said before selecting a model is itself a hyper parameter and therefore the creation of
neural network t. away with a very major hyper parameter selecting a model now of course as we've seen entire episode is not so simple what times your circumstances call for a shallow model whether it be for cocktail shellfish and sea or you don't have enough data to learn from your special case may call for shall learning model but increasingly we're getting to this point horses like throwing your old mauer get the situation it's his idea of sure you can use of this
or rifle why not just use a bazooka we've got the jeep use we've got two o'clock platform just use in your lab work neural networks also eliminated the very taxing hyper parameter called feature selection or feature engineering in the shallow learning days you need to be very selective about what features are going to input into your model in certain circumstances feature is better very highly correlated can mess up certain models
performance is so you want to hand removed any features that are highly correlated additionally you may need to steal features down and in case you have too many features you can do one of two things you can either hand removed specific features that you know or bad important or you can hide them for room a dimension ellie reduction malek principal component analysis p. c. a bid for typing it into your lyric ration mahler
decision tree so we have to hyper parameters there one is the feature engineering slash feature selection bit in the other is the decision to use p. c. a in this part of the equation the very time intensive process is not just some dial you turn like to tell one regulars asian parameter know besides the mitigation days to work with all neural networks few radically handle featuring cheering for you in the early layers of the neural network to mention ellie reduction
automatically occurs as long as you're layer width is less than the number of inputs hands in your arms in your own work learn to latch onto important bits of information and disregard less important bits of information so neural networks effectively eliminated feature engineering and model selection now obviously that some major over simplification and ruffling the feathers here i'm sure we'll get the point i'm getting at is over time these advance
and spin machine learning technology they do exactly that the remover hyper parameters and simpson them into the machine learning model as parameters so in other words over time ideally we will have to be dealing with so many hyper parameters and in fact google is so hot on this topic of automatic hyper brammer selection the credit project called on oh can i tell the concept of learning about the deal hyper parameters for your machine morning miles
cold metal learning right because you're learning how better to learn you learning the parameters that help you learn your parameters medal learning and gould has a project called on l. m. l. that they're working on very hard to solve this team points but in the meantime u. n. need we lowly developers are just enough to suffer with haber parameter selection and to me all right towards a top down approach restore from the very top of model selection
then once we get to neural networks restored to design layer architecture and then with in the layers were going to start to work on things like activation functions and regulars asian terms and stuff like this top-down all-star with mile selection you recall from the shallow learning episodes in the resources section i had a decision sri diagram that help you pick your machine learning model based on your situation is a classification or is it regression is a supervisor is
as supervise i will leave it to you to go back to that diagram that's kind of a very fine tune the model selection process on that paint with some very broad strokes here sort of that hot dogs in the shallow learning machine running models sold for soft are we dealing with unsupervised learning or supervise learning if you don't and surprise to good a totally different path of the less common sort of machine running scenario is honest and say hey k. means clustering was caught that for now moving on assuming you're using supervise learning it
assuming that you actually have the that labels to train on now or nascar solve some questions is the situation linear best first important question is your circumstance lean years the fingers heights learned linear equation honey no fits linear you can sort of think about it so for example selecting hyper parameters that isn't nonlinear situation and here is why many parameters play with each other in a specific way so for example warning rates a
and the pox or optimization steps the number of times you train on the specific batch learning rate and the pox us to play together specifically generally you want higher learning rate was lower the pox and vice versa okay so they play together important leaders for the connaught is a fresh hold it which lower learning rate or higher learning rate isn't going to help you no matter what the peacocks feathers kind of a cliff or maybe it's not
cliff may be of some something of a rabble occur anyway the point being this is not all in your situation when a situations are cases in which you can plot your data on line you know all of your data points problem on your graf an alternate scattered generally around the line or a hyperplasia dealing in more than two dimensions if you situation is linear these linear regression were logistic regression linear regression for regression to help her number like picasso house logistic regression for
suffocation deciding if it's a cat doctor tree if you don't know if situation is linear the general fahmy is given a shock trial in your religious aggression gunshot c. out as if it is nonlinear but you don't have a lot the lockup dana okay because the avalon of data binge probably just move on to the neural will work in but generally speaking lots of diego to deepen if you don't have a lot of data that there were no work with naive days decision trees and all the decision tree off
it's without rain forests gradient boosting extreme green boosting x g g that soup pot louise days which when you use try 'em all as you'll see with every however parameter the name again this trial mall any compare other relative performance of one malts the next by way of something called cross validation which will get to in the bit about grid search and ran and search so try we're aggression try logistic regression naive days decision trees ran a fourth
gradient boosting a tree maria boosted by the way ran a forests is like decision trees plus plus the better decision tree ingredient was saying is like decision tree plus plus plus it's like an even better decision tree and extreme gray and blues singer x g is even more better than all at so actually hear him decide to go the decision tree route you do yourself a favor by also trying ran for three and losing an extreme very interesting 'cause in theory all those are just barrel
mm decision trees anyway my advice if you're not be used neural network use gradient boosting that's my same d. fall by you that box i don't know what to do i generally start with gradient boosting which again is a spin off of decision tree but with a lot of optimization c. r. right now let's assume you have lots of date and you can enter the deep learning territory now regard to the blood or in this episode on network architecture and design network architecture
network designed to the first very high level decision you can make in your neural network architecture is what types of waiters are you going to use in other words which had a neural network business in the first place you really have the main three decisions to choose from l. s. d. m. r. n. n.'s consonants and mall file your perception on this is plenty of other networked architectures out there to set up web page called the neural networks do when you can look at images
descriptions of different types of neural networks like belief nets an ongoing quarter's those two for example are actually very popular author neural network architectures the size of freedom i just listed and then there's a whole bunch more of those are more advanced topics indeed learning to the very common architectures our c. n. n. r. n. n. and m. l. p. and they have very obvious use cases redoing vision soft calm lucille new network c. n. n. beijing trying stuff l. s. d. m. r. and review
in other penalty so let's think of a few examples for these situations you generally use accomplish only only work if you doing visions office you're looking at pictures you're playing a video game if you're building itself driving car division is of all you use a cnn if time is involved you doing stock trading if you're doing whether production or natural language processing you'll use in l. s. t. amar n. n. a record neural network anyway you'll have to necessarily zealous t. and t. can use of vanilla recurring yeoman work week
news of g. r. u. recurred yeoman work but the most popular that same d. fault is alice tim cells in our n. n. for time series date and for everything else he'll use 'em all tellier perception on the space billing throwing all your inputs in a blender doesn't have time it doesn't have space then it doesn't have anything see frodo blender and they'll be okay then how about or pickling training baht will die just said stocks is a time series phenomenon so well
t. m. are immense actually we're using a convolution all neural network in a market how project not an l. s. t. m. or n. n. what's nice is c. n. n. supervision and you said specifically that stock is high series entire series is else am i did indeed but this is one of those cases we start with the d. fault and i did indeed start with alice t. m.'s and then you experiment with alternatives using grid search ran and serge be easier not to ms
shit and i found through experimentation that cnn swerved to better hands after reading a handful of other papers out there on archive dot org and takeda collies were doing our rhythmic treating you would hear that many people out there greed or have had the same experience that confidence i'll perform else t. m.'s for al rhythmic trading why in mind that the i actually don't know the reason that surprises you or i. files tim's would shine here i think
the reason is something i've read as well is vanishing in exploding radiance remember from the n. l. p. episodes i said that the impetus for the invention of the l. s t m cell was that work for neural networks had this thing called vanishing in exploding gradient problem da da those that you've taken frames steps in its kind series dataset in order to predict something maybe the next time sat or some value will have too many times that you basically all
overwhelm demure on spin your neural network you sort of piling on information after information after information anything causes exploding gradient they call it were you saturate your neural it's it's kind of like yelling too loudly in these neurons exploding there's blood everywhere it's a horrible problem or the opposite to the case we don't have enough signal going back through time steps in the training process because the signal gets dampened indebted over time that's called a vanishing breed in problem in the way we made
it is was replaced the way you lou activation function or colonel minorities pluck that were you activation function out in your own and replaced it with outsell the l. s t m sell long short term memory cell which has a whole bunch of complex architecture within it's not just some activation functions like we plucked out this little marble when you're on the power of the network through way that we popped in this they would pop in this complex watch looking konzi
and yours block and we sat in that place at the palace to nothing has the capacity to learn to forget time sequences overtime in latch on the specific time sequences overtime which allows it to mitigate the banishing exploding gradient problem blacks blacks you only really see that showcased in medial ain't crying sequences like a sentence mean what's the maximum number of words and senseless a fifty a hundred words that's okay that's fine k.
no no problem but can a candle in the infinite sequence of steps will be quite price history is an infinite sequence of stat semi we go away back to two thousand nine in second intervals always home now and in millions and millions of steps at a huge going so goes off into the future to infinity so can and l. s t m are then really handle that many steps i don't know actually personally but i think that's the running theory as to why alice tim's to work on so
prices is that maybe they actually can't handle the fin soup kitchens were very very very large sequences there's always the dinner round that i've heard about stopping training for time step to a maximum window link in the past but did they get spree harry so what about cars natalie make that work for stock prices were but we're back when prices while the human goes to a exchanged terminal on the computer like g. x. dot com they got black screen and they have a price graf
it goes up and down up and it's made out of candlesticks that are colored red and green and under the price graff is if mr graham of all you will last visual you can imagine actually taking a screen shot of g. dax wants every second at saving it's your computer and running that for your comment to train on now that's an intuitive approach but clear perot just actually use the same day you're using for for alex to am namely camels the daily chelsea the air will do is
bill construct the time window with it x. axis is your time just like you would be in your exchange terminal the x. axis this crime stats ends this the axis actually the channels or death of your picture it's basically like that or g. b. channels what would be the orgy be channels of a normal picture you actually use your features they are so the depth of your picture is your candlestick and then the height of the picture is is nothing that says
this is one so it's like to be the shimmering model is visually looking at a time window of christ the in order to determine whether buy sell hold okay so that's deciding on what type of layers to use mauer it talked about the shape of your neural network later with an number of layers and where you might play c.'s alice yeah more conflicts by the way most yoga works we'll have some amount of dense layers even if they are incontinent
most other layers bark han's players may be in the very end you'll still have one or two dance players and if you're nellis c. n. new may still have moved some amount of densely years before they'll ask him where is an award after them and then slayer remember is just a vanilla neural network layer is called dance because all neuroscience from the prior layer connects to all neurons of the current later everything finex every which way so as gets okay
neural network shape there is a saying the faults that that's recommended you to find out there on stack overflow i've seen this quote it comes from a textbook and ono which textbook but see no word over ennis says the same d. fall for network shape goes like this have you can put where he's not really aware but the color layers the dispute is happier pinpoints the heavier out we're in that's usually does anyone you're on the classification or regression situation in the same old psych class classic
a sin situation bill last layer is a soft max new on soft max which will talk about in the activation functions bit see every pussy outlets know what goes in between word in layers that's the thing that you really care about was saying the fall of number of layers is one one hand where they need to be theo know anything else about your situation you just have the gas shot in the dark one or two layers star with one hand give to a shot in your hyper perimeter search how bout with whelan
we're in your own spin your one layer the same diesel would be the meanest love the number of inputs and the number of outputs soviet backed three inputs and wanted out what you one hand layer should have to your odds demeanor of your input center outlets are just get smaller basically performing to michelle de reduction on your inputs that the same d. fall some networks call for much larger structure i mean five twelve new ron's four layers deep
it's only depends on the situation but you know anything at all go with the water two layers and be with inner layers being the mien of your input in outlets by all la times you can actually think about a week into it the shape of your neural network so remember it our episode i talked about using your own network to detect off base at ours actually describing a mall tyler perceptual to to detective face what you usually uses of consonants lesko of the mold eyewear
perceptual example this because it it allows us to think a little clearer about this yeah a picture of a face by tickled by five pixels case of twenty five pixels total it's an image on your hard drive that's your input where is your pixels now you might reconstruct the face by combining black dots in your pixels into line is lines and curves and edges and angles how many of these types of things could you imagine i'll essay last say six six types of kerr
i'm sun angles lines so your first layer in the neural network will be six new rots next will combine those lines in edges and stuffed into shapes eyes ears mouth and nose for ice years now those are for neurons is going to detect for types of objects in the next layer and finally the last layer is one neuron to combine all the i's years mouth and nose into face that one me
on being faced detector so twenty five pixels boil down into six angles and edges and curves in lines those boil down into four objects spies years mouth and nose and those boil down into wanna object the face so you can actually think your way through the design of the neural network architecture it's not so old black box as people make it out to be necessarily sometimes it is sometimes you have no clue how things work come by
aim higher to play like that and so you go with the same d. fall in use hyper perimeter search to try to find better and better networked architectures from there in this case with face detector you would indeed was still use hyper perimeter search to find a better architecture over time 'cause you're almost always in the wrong the first time this is something reasonable to start with our bit coin trading by well we have only chelsea open high low close volume feels that that's our features for ty
is that now like i said i'm actually using a consonant in the code but i think it'll be easier in clearer to explain it as an l. s t m arnett song and do it that way each times that takes in a candlestick five features those your input in the outlet word essay is the decision to buy or sell the only exists in reinforcement loring moll unsupervised learning malo would basically be predicting the next price action and then from there you decide whether buyer cell
so let's assume we're using the reinforcement learning scenario we have inside are reinforcing learning asian else to model where the inputs are five features a kill sick in the top what is one you're on the decision to buy or sell which incidentally is gonna be at hand at each activation function of talk about that next up so what was in the middle we definitely want and l. s t m layer right because it's kind series we want a layer of it's building up information over time about how lucy
graff is acting in order that can predict the price at the next time step so theoretically we just need one else him where and according to the idea of the d. full width is the mean of the inputs in the output do with the bureau austen layers three three osceola cells is single layer bing bang boom malice play with the slow but we have five features coming from one exchange which we wanted to do that arbitrage thing that risk arbitrage thing i mentioned last episode that you have to
it features a camel sick from g. x. and a candlestick for crack and i have ten features coming in let's nice usually more data is better more features a better option to a certain point it tends to be sort of this ceiling we start to reach was called the curse of dimension out yet too much information now i don't think tennis too much information the last pretended is what could you do leave he added dense layer above your palace kiam way or as the first layer at a new layer
between the inputs n. your palace tim we're incidents where was it do it boils down the inputs into their essence well we make the width of this den slayer for we boil down ten inputs to four and then we send those off the l. s. d. m. weirdest are doing the history crunching they do we don't wanna overwhelm at one ascended the assets will let the den slayer boil the essence very nice very nice to have a dance where the top performing demand shelly reduction on the
it puts in passing it off to the l. s. d. m. where which is performing historical analysis on that time steps now remember entire episode i mention these things called indicators we have these numbers they can summarize some amount of time steps in the past was a two hundred times sets in the past till now you might want to take the simple moving average s. and may be exponential looming average dna the relative strength index far as i estimate for example wrappers
ends the moving average did the direction as a number from two hundred times steps in the past so managed to basically think of it like that like became call from then till now it's positive if we're going up it's negative going down now we can use a third party library called technical analysis library to khalid the t. a hyphen lip and we are in our project actually we hear is that projects to generate these numbers given the time window and pipe those in his input to talk
that is a problem that the problem is we'll have to decide which technical indicators use which indicators we were used as president thompson cons of them hands for each of those indicators what is the time horizon two hundred stepson hundred steps a thousand steps so those are just add additional hyper parameters wants your plates no will excite her parameters now normally more day as better in fact we are experimenting with khalid in
the project the present pulling it here is because we have and l. s t m layer and palestinian we're already learns aggregated information about your historical data it's already doing this ruling process is building up its own theory about what's going on through the time stamps in other words it's kind of building its own technical indicators so why don't we just let l. s t m automatically learn technical indicators rather than piping them in arts
also they can learn whatever sequence of time steps it likes what did the two hundred or four hundred and eight learned which specific in eight years in it's own little intervals are valuable for its projections in other words it's going to automatically were an estimate or the dna depending on what proves useful to the l. s. t. m. so what we do here well we here at a. neither knew ron in the lowest him we're for every technical indicators we want
the layer to learn so let's just grab bag ten indicators coming next a decent number of indicators that you might use in a typical i'll go trading bought ten indicators let's have our calloused him where learned ten indicators all wanted some solace and tenure on studio steel we're very close about allows us to reduce the amount of hyper parameters we had to deal with dry we have a decent model here for trading now are trained not if we spend it as a reinforce that learning our room which is in code is going to give a
the decision is going to give us what's called a signal the amount it wants us to buy or the amount it wants us to sell or zero for hold there's something missing from this equation though it's telling us to buy and sell based on price history but doesn't know how much money we have to or name that buy and sell where it doesn't know how much u. s. dollars we have been g. x. that we can buy with it doesn't know how much bit coin we haven't she acts to selwyn
now we could just in our code saying by only what we can afford based on our box suggestion but ideally the baht will suggest a price to buy and sell based on what you have that way if you don't have as much you'll say will you can still buy a little now a benefit so ideally your balances would also be an input now you don't wanna at your balance is as an input at the top why because in your
alan says get mixed in with the history it's like you from ru we're balances your bit coin balance and your dollars balance it's hot in this in this palace tim blender and now you have your doses splattered all over the graph all over this price grafted it's built up for us all for technical indicators of staff he had your balance is all over the history should be on affected by your balance the balance only pertains to now the present moment so what can we do we can actually pipetter balances
as the inputs to the final muir on the final later in the neural network you can't hide in the net at any point in the network doesn't actually have to happen at the very beginning to happen at any later he became pipe in additional features in you'll see this lot without image captioning where one for the network is handling image recognition another part of the network is handling natural image processing and then they connect with each other down stream so narco what we do here
this week that the present day that this stationery hearing now dana downstream in the network you know later later pass the time series all where layers being alice t. m. sir complainers focus the point there was you can imagine building the networks shape in selecting the types of layers all by yourself an intuitive fashion even though neural network is a theoretical black box you can shape even malden with your hands
the someone you know about the situation and then use hyper perimeter search search for a more optimal number of layers and width of layers billet suck out all of the more time actually sana jump into activation functions nonlinear eddie's besides spectator gets you in the next episode activation functions and bring your honor in the thin layers of the neural network have applied to them and activation function activation function or no
on linear eat these are things like sycapip install --upgrade pip setuptools
more ada chan h. raya lu ann like now and activation function is the function that you apply after the weeded som every neural inside of it is basically all linear regression units is just awaited some of the prior i'm your odds so learns these waves where is the fate of parameters just like a linear regression to multiply coefficients by for every muir on a prior where does it
so when you're aggression unit and then you'll rap that linear regression unit in activation function in a non linear function something like us a moya were ten a jury will know why do we do that why we have to wrap it in something when we just have a bunch of linear regression units all connected to each other and call the neural network of the reason is that linear functions when combines they make another linear function in other words if we did that if everything you're on with lyric rushing you
at our result would be a linear machine learning model so to only learn linear situations like the price of house it could learn something so complex is a face detector why is that this is strange if he had a bunch of lines me from all the piece of paper you don't have one big law aimed yeah something comes or looking whittling soros slice every which direction on a tapestry a new deal look how about the d. n. the parts of course learning part of the machine learning process will learn how to slice
are to partition things into their own colleagues rights is no way you'd get by combining multiple we're functions know you would get a big lie you would actually get another line that sort of the average of all these little lines it's very interesting is no you'd expect so you have to transform these neurons and into nonlinear versions of themselves so that you don't just end up with a big line so how do we do that we applied on
nonlinear function to it we played it through something that adds weevils any wiggle a wee little all that matters is that we we hold your breath because when you shake up one to wilson from onto a piece of paper you do have wheels that slice of paper like zorro zorro with curves curvy zorro you don't get one giant wiggle your budget criss crossing we goals subway we make our neural network nonlinear which is super super born that's all pointed neural network is it's you
versatile nonlinear function proxmire is that we just had wheels we just take the lawyer is there pal put that every neuron and we bend them into it for us now the classic curve that we've seen before it is the single way function that s. curve is impasse between zero and wants us to see that's autograph between zero one an alternative version of that is it's gannett h. t. a n. e. h. th function which is in pasture
so it is signori function just like that logistic aggression unit black goes between native won and won so that to haul ass to reapply either of these goodies a signal in activation function or giza th activation function with what should we use well we should actually used him h. actually don't know why a signal when it isn't used very commonly annual awards and must be something with the math but c. n. h. is much preferred as activation function in your own melor a kind of makes sense for training
i because every near on an their work is taking in with its own two cents as to whether to buy or sell right to an aged goes from native one to one in other words by some amount by some multiplication up between zero and positive one or sell some amount sell some multiplication between zero and made of one so each new ironic is sending their own buy and sell signals they all have their own lil
opinion and in the final muir on sort collects all the votes toys all boats and says you know what i think the majority is raising their hand that we should buy satanic sometimes makes sense i don't get exactly why you can transform a signal a into the equivalent of o. myself action but for every see you still see lots ignored used within your own math works why you see a lot more common than signal is or ten age is something called ray lou rectified linear unit are you
no you are really so we're one we lose it in only neary he's not lying in that wasn't born two boys almost ally it's a lie and that's why he full zero four x. equals zero to native affinities and then this angle going to the top flight so it's kind of like a hockey stick were of the babysitter take over god doesn't seem very useful into would've we come in i can't think of how you'd sort of hold myself sick
was that lawyer come up with any other sort of been into it application of this activation sunshine are really understand why it works but for whatever reason it's computation lee more efficient on you can cure it's faster to run something about populace works more efficient on this function and importantly the negates the vanishing in exploring gradient problem it turns out the vanishing in exploding great calm is not only with r. n. n.'s is with a
a deep networks and cons next specifically tend to be very very very deep bee stings like resonating google met stuff they're very deep many convolution layers and so we use ray wu activation functions in those layers to mitigate the vanishing exploding graham papa i don't understand why i don't know why it may be sat problem but it's it's something about the math something about calculus and therefore or you'll see aurelio activation
function used much more commonly than anything else is the same d. faults that comes out of the box with a neural network one of those things where id fault your dance layers in your kong's layers you saw ray will bite the fall and then you'll use hibor surged to try to an age and see if it performs better than raven there's a handful of other types of ray what is already live family is something called bullied you re loop that you will acts
and then shoulder your unit the l. u. days see lucas the alley you there's c. or yellow you korea will always different types of rae lewis they they kind of baby look slightly different they kind of had that hockey stick shaped some emperors the edge off of the hockey stick elbow and some of them don't stay at white people zero towards native if anybody actually curve down hold it to the bottom left port
they didn't say they'll have little different twists they're kind of more modern versions of re woo the researchers are trying a whole name on that the perfect way wu is another thing where you might wanna try different versions of re woo with hyper perimeter search tried you in siu in korea and leaky ray what all those things there's also a thing put out by google in their grand quest to eliminate hyper parameters called the swish estelle you i ask each so
shh activation function is actually a you'll are noble activation functional learns what's the best activation function for your neural network during the training process which shall be so sweet to be really nice not to have to choose and activation functioning a hyper parameters cell signal a soft max ray wu and the relive family and generally ray lose used by the fall trial mall using hyper search if find what works best for your neural net
or for cars in my experience in our bit coin schrader gets ten h. and those of the activation functions for the thin layers though the activation functions for the near the internal new islands communicating with each other till last miron rubble last layer of your neural network is the output layers that output function is the thing that can give you the human something of value so if it's a classification scenario we will use the same way function actually is
this time we can use the same weight is because it gives a classification see you the human that when that signal would function is valuable you could use it to an age where using it to an asian our situation is a good buy or sell signal you could use nothing is one case were you can not have been activation function what would that be as regression without an activation functional wrapping up your waited som when you get is the way that song that's the l. put that a number
now might be the cost of a house for example so no activation function for aggression scenarios and then it for malt psych class classification dark hack tree you use a soft masks soft max that same old psych class version of a signal which function and don't always just as the output layer of your neural network you would have a soft max inside of your neural networks in layers awesome guy so on episode i apologize for calling
all the resources i've listen up until now was wearing all this information from seoul is nothing new to put the resources section and next time will talk about ray there is a shin optimize years future scaling naturalization is finally paper search of how to do that with creatures such document
