welcome to the first episode of machine learning guide or an algae which is a high caste structured as an audio course whose intent is to teach you the high level principles of machine learning in artificial on tall jumps in this pie cast i will provide you the bird's eye overview of the fundamental concepts a machine learning this includes things like models and algorithms both shall loring models and people earning models shallow learning machine learning models
include sings like linear logistic regression naive bazan decision trees which has a machine learning newbie you may not have heard of but i also cover people earning models which i'm sure you have heard of things like neural networks convolution ono met works and ricard neural networks all discuss the languages and frame works that you wanna use in machine where in all talk about python to answer flow psychic weren't hiked porch these types of topics all discuss that
allowable the math you need to know to succeed in machine learning this includes calculus statistics and when you're algebra and i will go into all these topics in as much data as ordeal all hours

as a totally different beast reinforcement learning to knead is where most of the fallen in the action is happening in machine running right now i consider reinforcement learning to be sort of the real ai in machine learning the stuff that makes you think is this thing thinking if the real juice and meet it's the stuff that the mind is most heavily involved in it's also the stuff that sort of reaches its roots into the field all of planning and searching and we
reasoning in knowledge representation each other fields of artificial intelligence supervise learning is really interesting because it applies to fields like vision that in speech you can imagine for example where you are training machine running our brief them on my quarters of dialogue and it learns kind of what makes sentence structure common from one sense to the next so that they can actually construct sense on its bone can have a conversation with you that supervise learning or reinforce
that learning is involved in taking actions taking steps so for example robots taking us that in an environment or artificial intelligence bad guy in a video game trying to figure out how best to kill you the way reinforcement learning works is that you give that goal was pretender we've got a mouse in the game may is trying to find she's at the end of the maze the goal is that she's at the end of the maze and then you give it to us
system of reward and punishment that's the reinforcements that so let's say that if it gets that she's sick it's a hundred points and if it falls into a pit of doom they lose a hundred points the reinforcement machine running out for them will figure out on it's own what are the rules of the game where the action sick intake and the best strategy to achieving its goal soap on like supervise learning were you the programmer sure amy arboretum which it with
bunch of degas in it warns the equation for what all this data has in common in order to protect the numeric value or class the reinforcement our rhythm warren's from its own behavior what actions to take an environment so reinforcement learning is sort of action oriented and get trains itself c. can see why this is the really juicy cool stuff now unfortunately i'm not very savvy on the world of reinforce that learning by match
we'll learning a lot of those algorithms myself right now but also saw field it presents itself to people who were just getting started in the world machine learning algorithms early on reinforcement learning is an advanced topic in machine running soap or not to recover reinforcement learning for a long while many many many episodes down the pike
ot of stuff that goes and cheer
crafts your chopping vegetables you're putting together arrested the than the final step is putting a tray in the oven hitting start in that final step is actually cooking the dish so that's that is the namesake for cooking the field of cooking just like the learned step of calculus by way of gray in the sand machine learning is the namesake of machine learning and by the way we've been talking about calculus as a means for descending the error graf by way of agreed to send this apple cage
of calculus towards minimizing some function is a branch of mathematics called optimization borges convex optimization convex means that the graph sort of looks like a cop for twenty to the bottom of that caught convex is caught in the shape of a graph we're trying to traverse the graph by way of calculus to the bottom of the cop this is a spinoff of calculus called convex optimization in the same way that physics is a spinoff of calculus optimization is

ries on cancer flow and i've consumed a handful of various media for tessa for myself but the thing that i actually found to be the best resource for learning center flow was actually just the documentation on the website dictatorial support there
a thorough of course the roy's opted which is something that one of these other media can achieve that they have very thorough tutorials to go along with cody thin and examples folder of the tense or flow project itself that you can reference so i highly recommend to the tester flow tutorials and that is it for this episode friends see you next time


welcome back to machine learning that i'm your host tyler not penalty teaches the fundamentals of the machine running an artificial intelligence the covers of intuition models math languages for him works and what were your father machine learning the resources to provide the trees by provide the forest that visual is the best primary learning modality the audio isn't ringside wanted during exercise commute in shorts and consider him out here syllabus with highly curator resources for you

your washing all this stuff up yourself by pointing and clicking your way through the dub u. s. consul the reason for that is it's hard to track changes of your architecture overtime or snow what services you have running in which ones are affiliated with each other or less say you make a change in your keep track of that change we want to keep track of that change unless
all less stuff is stored in cold as a as a project i'm using called care reform perform it is what's called infrastructure as code it lets you manage all of the deploying all of your quads services in a cold file you can check in that file to get up
